<A NAME="whatis"></A>What is Gnumeric</H3>
The Gnumeric spreadhseet is part of the <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</A>
desktop environment: a project to create a user friendly free desktop environment.&nbsp;
As every other component of GNOME, Gnumeric is <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</A>&nbsp; and it is licensed under the terms of the GNU <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL.</A>
<P>You can see some <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/gnumeric/screenshots">screenshots</A>
of Gnumeric.
<P>Gnumeric is intended to be a replacement for a commercial spreadsheet,
so a lot of effort and work has still to go into it, but I believe we have
the right framework to do it.

<h3>Gnumeric 0.11 has been released</h3>
I am sorry if I am not keeping up with updating the web
page as I make releases, but I am a bit busy.<p>
Since the last version of Gnumeric we have got piles of
new features.  A list of everything since 0.5 is available <a
href="gnumeric-7-11.txt">here.</a>
<p>
Shortly: we have nicer tools, for an improved UI experience;  Documentation
is shipped with the code;  Excel improting code is better more robust;  Less
memory leaks;  inter-sheet references.<p>

<h3>Gnumeric 0.5 has been released</h3>
New features<p>
<ul>
<li>Scheme for registering new file format handlers (load and save).
<li>Fixed all of the reported bugs from 0.4
</ul>
<h3>Gnumeric 0.4 has been released</h3>
You can see the complete announcement <a href="gnumeric-0.4.txt">here</a><p>
New features<p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Meeks and Bruno Unna did an awesome job while I was doing
    this: They added Excel file importing.  That is all I can say.  Some
    stuff is missing, yes, it will get added, yes.

<li>During the last few weeks Morten Welinder has been reviewing the
   Gnumeric code and making very good suggestions to the coding style as
   well as making sure we keep Gnumeric in a nice way.  I am very thankful
   for his input.

<li> Jakub Jelinek made the scrolling code be smarter than my previous
     attempt at scrolling, it is now definetly usable.

<li> Code for attaching notes to cell is completely on the code.  The
     only problem is that right now comment is hardcoded in the source code.
     We need a nice dialog box for this.

<li> Mark Probst added some Guile support (this as well as the other
    plugins is completely optional), some neat things can be done with it,
    make sure you check the distribution directory.

<li> Exponentiation has been implemented (all the code was there, I just
     had forgotten to add the line to the grammar).
</ul>

<h3>Gnumeric 0.3 has been released</h3>
New features since last version:<p>
<ul>
<li>Support for cut and paste trough the X selection.

<li>Auto-convert-on-input features: When you enter text in Gnumeric
it is now matched against the known formats of Gnumeric and if
possible, converted to a (number, format) pair.  This works
when you enter a formula and when you type in text.

This means you can use now dates and times in expressions, like
this: ="10-Jan"+45.  

Autofill will also work on this.

<li>Working python module with sample python function.  

<li>Much more documentation (thanks a lot to Adrian Likins
for all the effort he has put into documenting Gnumeric).  A
general introduction to Gnumeric is include as well, as
sections on editing, formulas, autofill and drag and drop is included

<li>Fixes for the teams doing internationalization.  A document
describing the guidelines to translate certain parts of
Gnumeric is included.

<li>Lots of bug fixes.  
</ul>
<H3>
<A NAME="future"></A>Future projects</H3>
In the future, I would like to add support for Guile modules, as well as
using the Guile computation engine for the native number formats in Gnumeric
(which would give us arbitrary precision integers, and support for precise
and imprecise numbers as well as other goodies).
<P>Printing is going to be achieved by the GNOME priting framework which
is being designed right now by Raph Levien.
<P>Read the README and the Future-Roadmap files included with Gnumeruic
to learn more about our plans with Gnumeric.
<p>Graphics in Gnumeric will be implemented by using the
<a href="/guppi">GUPPI</a> plotting engine trough CORBA and the
Baboon infrastructure.
<p>
Michael Meeks and Bruno Unna have been working on Excel import code.  Talk to them
if you are interested in helping the project. 

<H3>
<A NAME="corba"></A>CORBA, compound documents</H3>
As part of the GNOME desktop, Gnumeric will be using the <A HREF="http://cvs.labs.redhat.com/ORBit">ORBIT</A>
CORBA implementation to expose its services to the world and it will be
a Baboon component (Baboon is the compound document architecture of GNOME).
<H3>
<A NAME="plugin"></A>Plugin system</H3>
Gnumeric has a plugin system based on shared libraries right now (which
means that all plugins right now fall under the GNU GPL). A plugin exists
for defining your own functions in Python.
<P>Part of this CORBA integration will enable people to write non-GPL plugins
(I understand this is something some people might want to do, and for them,
the CORBA-based plugin architecture will fit their needs). This is not
yet implemented, but will soon be.
<H3>
<A NAME="lists"></A>Mailing lists</H3>
The Gnumeric mailing list can be reached at <A HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list@gnome.org">gnumeric-list@gnome.org</A>.
If you want to subscribe to the mailing list, send mail to:
<A HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list-request@gnome.org">gnumeric-list-request@gnome.org</A>
and in the body of your message put the word "subscribe".
<H3>
<A NAME="getting"></A>Getting Gnumeric</H3>
As with any other software in GNOME, you can fetch the latest development
version of Gnumeric from the <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/devel/whatiscvs.shtml">GNOME
Anonymous CVS</A> and from the GNOME CVS from the module "gnumeric".
<P>To compile Gnumeric you will need the gnome-libs package and the gnome-xml
package. The gnome-libs package in turn requires glib, gtk+ and the imlib
packages.
<H3>
<A NAME="Thanks">Thanks to</a></H3>
Tom Miller at <a href="http://www.xess.com">XESS</a> for helping me
understand various spreadsheet issues and making the source code for
his first spreadsheet program available to me for study.
<p>
