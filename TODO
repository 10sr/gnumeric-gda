Gnumeric Spread Sheet task list

* Component

   Make sheet_selection_changed_hook execute a list of hooks 
   Remove the hardcoded workbook hooks from the sheet.
   Initialize the hooks on the workbook_new routine.

   The model is somewhat broken.  sheet_new creates a sheet_view by
   default. 

   I think we need something like: workbook_new and workbook_view_new
   to split this sort of thing.

* Cell editing

   Pressing F4 when editing a cell formula, should switch a cell
   reference in the following cycle:

     A4 -> $A$4 -> $A4 -> A$4 -> A4

* Even More Functions

   GROWTH, LINEST, LOGEST, PERCENTILE, MDETERM,
   QUARTILE, TREND.

   (This is not a claim that these are all.)

* Printing
  * Screen layout is broken for right justified text.
  * Save print information in workbook
  * Load print information from workbook
  * Preview
  * Print setup: 
    * Implement Print Preview, Options buttons
    * Improve layout 
    * Provide GUI for margin editing.
  * Add headers and footers
  * Add left, middle right header/footer support
  * Add the missing options to the Print Dialog
  * Display printing status (pages to go).
  * Add column/row title printing
  * Add color printing support.

* Font dialog

  * Get the list of *valid* fonts from GnomePrint
  * Create a simplistic dialog (to map to font-bold yes/no).

* Cell dimension computation is broken on font change for multilines.

* Number formatting

   The formatting code should take the current GtkFont for the cell
   being formatted as well as the width allowed and take this into
   account to render the number as well as possible given the space so
   that for small regions, numbers in scientific notation are displayed.

* Sheet

** Cell data entry:
   double click on cell allows editing as in main editing box.

** Headers for Columns and Rows

   The captions should be customizable, ie instaed of "A1", it should
   be possible to display "Sales".  We can use this with Michael's
   name support. 

** Captions (ItemBar)

   It should be possible to set the dimensions of the cols, rows to
   contain information as "min_points", "max_points".  

   Interesting side effect: min_points == max_points means "fixed". 

* Auditing
   Write the sheet auditing code.

* Searching

   Searching text on the spreadhseet.

* EDITION

** Object Clipboard
   If sheet->mode is OBJECT_SELECTED cut/copy/paste should operate on
   the object.

   Object properties.

** Paste special 

  needs some little changes:
  - When formulas are pasted with an operation,
    the new ExprTree should be created with the operation.

** Style

  Borders:

  Color/patterns

  Protection:
    Bloqued/Hidden

** Keyboard shortcuts

* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

  Add "hints" to the file save routine based on the registered
  formats.

* Display Engine

* Unicode support throughout

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:

   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert

** Summary Information
   Load this from the Excel stream.
   Make a Bonobo component to update it.
   Load/Save to XML.

* Sheets

When adding a sheet or renaming a sheet, should we reparse everything?

* Clipboard

Perhaps make a global clipboard and remove all the hacks in the
current clipboard code to find the clipboard.

* Sheet Objects

Rewrite the entire support for sheet objects.  I do not like the code
at *all*.

* Styles

Rewrite all cell style support, for memory efficiency and speed.
Rewrite background pixmap handling to take 2 colours: FG & BG.

* Names

Update xml-io to read/write name tables.

* Office compatibility

Write an XML plugin to output 'Publish as Web' style XML for
Office 2000 and 'explorer' compatibility.

* Internals

  * Kill cell_set_font in its current way, the font used to encode
    type, size, boldness and italicness.  This is not the case
    anymore.  We should kill this and only use
    cell_set_font_from_style.

  * Exceptions.

    Currently some code is refusing to make changes when an array
    operation is acted on.  This code is inside the core, and a CORBA
    client might find this problem without being able to do anything
    about it, nor knowing about the error condition.
