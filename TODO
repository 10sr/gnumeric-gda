GNOME Spread Sheet task list

* Cell range naming

   Finish implementing.

* Cell dimensio computation is broken on font change for multilines.

* Number formatting

   The formatting code should take the current GtkFont for the cell
   being formatted as well as the width allowed and take this into
   account to render the number as well as possible given the space so
   that for small regions, numbers in scientific notation are displayed.

* 
* Sheet

** Cell data entry:
   double click on cell allows editing as in main editing box.

* Auditing
   Write the sheet auditing code.

* EDITION

** Object Clipboard
   If sheet->mode is OBJECT_SELECTED cut/copy/paste should operate on
   the object.

   Object properties.

** Paste special 

  needs some little changes:
  - When formulas are pasted with an operation,
    the new ExprTree should be created with the operation.

** Style

  Borders:

  Color/patterns

  Protection:
    Bloqued/Hidden

** Keyboard shortcuts

* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

  Add "hints" to the file save routine based on the registered
  formats.

* CORBA exporting

* Perl bindings.

* Display Engine

* Unicode support throughout

** item-edit

   This should be improved to use a cell rendering routine.
   which should be shared between item-grid and item-edit, to
   get life feedback on the result.

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:

   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert

* Cell selection

   It does not shrink.

* Basic functions

   V/H LOOKUP, UPPER, LOWER

* Excel importing

   Sort out mul-blank records.

   Sensible Unicode support.

   Add collation of BIFF continuation records to the
   previous record, to save many checks in the code.

* OLE

   Serious testing required.
   Integrate 'advance' into read_copy, and write, and rename to lseek

   Snarf wine OLE API.
