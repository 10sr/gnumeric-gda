* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

  Add a format registration input point.


* CORBA exporting

* Perl bindings.

* Display Engine

** item-edit

   This should be improved to use a cell rendering routine.
   which should be shared between item-grid and item-edit, to
   get life feedback on the result.

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:
   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert
     

* Cell selection

   It does not shrink.
