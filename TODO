GNOME Spread Sheet task list

* Comments

   Comments location needs to be reset on col/row dimenssion changes.

* Cell range naming

   Finish implementing.

* Cell references to other sheets.

* Number formatting

   The formatting code should take the current GtkFont for the cell
   being formatted as well as the width allowed and take this into
   account to render the number as well as possible given the space so
   that for small regions, numbers in scientific notation are displayed.

* Sheet

* Auditing
   Write the sheet auditing code.

* EDITION

** Object Clipboard
   If sheet->mode is OBJECT_SELECTED cut/copy/paste should operate on
   the object.

** Paste special 

  needs some little changes:
  - When formulas are pasted with an operation,
    the new ExprTree should be created with the operation.

** Style

  Borders:

  Color/patterns

  Protection:
    Bloqued/Hidden

** Keyboard shortcuts

* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

  Add a format registration input point.


* CORBA exporting

* Perl bindings.

* Display Engine

* Unicode support throughout

** item-edit

   This should be improved to use a cell rendering routine.
   which should be shared between item-grid and item-edit, to
   get life feedback on the result.

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:
   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert
     

* Cell selection

   It does not shrink.

* Excel importing

   Add collation of BIFF continuation records to the
   previous record, to save many checks in the code.

   Sort out formula conversion to use gnumerics representation
   instead of strings.

* OLE

   Serious testing required.
