GNOME Spread Sheet task list

* EDITION

** Paste special 

  needs some little changes:
  - When formulas are pasted with an operation,
    the new ExprTree should be created with the operation.

** Context menus:

  We need context menus for the spreadsheet:
     - Cut/Copy/Paste/Paste-Special
     - Insert
       Move cells to the right
       Move cells to the bottom
       Insert a complete row
       Insert a complete col
     - Delete
       Move cells to the left
       MOve cells to the top
       Delete a row
       Delete a col
     - Cell formats

** Style

  The complete cell style dialog box needs  to be implemented
  
  Numbers:
    Format engine is required.

    Items:
        Format categories
	Format representation
	Input line for typing a new format
	Test display (from using the selected cell)

  Alignment:
    Horizontal:
      General/Left/Right/Center/Justify/
          Center with respect to selection.
    Vertical
      Up/Center/Fown/Justify

    Automatic return check box
      This automatically "wraps" text when it overflows the cell

    Orientation
      horizontal
      vertical: 3 types of string display.

  Fonts:

  Borders:

  Color/patterns

  Protection:
    Bloqued/Hidden

** Visual move.

   If drag happens with button 3, context menu does provide:
     Copy
     MOve
     Copy formats
     Copy values
     move cells toward bottom and copy
     move cells toward right and copy
     move cells toward bottom and move
     move clels toward right and move

   Operation on the border:

   Button-1: The default option is to just move and asks if
             there are conflicts.

   Shift-Button-1: moves the target cells and moves
     (depending on which side is selected top/left)

   Contorl-Button-1: copies the cells.
          
* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

* Scrolling

** Fix the "make_cell_visible" routine, as the cell
   should be entirely visible, not just partially.

** Nice page scrolling with tooltips
** Scrollbar scrolling

* CORBA exporting

* Perl bindings.

* Display Engine

** item-edit

   This should be improved to use a cell rendering routine.
   which should be shared between item-grid and item-edit, to
   get life feedback on the result.

* Style manager
 
   Implement style regions.
   Implement style resolution at cell creation time.

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:
   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert
