GNOME Spread Sheet task list

* EDITION

** Paste special 

  needs some little changes:
  - When formulas are pasted with an operation,
    the new ExprTree should be created with the operation.

** Style

  Alignment:
    Horizontal:
      General/Left/Right/Center/Justify/
          Center with respect to selection.
    Vertical
      Up/Center/Fown/Justify

    Automatic return check box
      This automatically "wraps" text when it overflows the cell

    Orientation
      horizontal
      vertical: 3 types of string display.

  Fonts:

  Borders:

  Color/patterns

  Protection:
    Bloqued/Hidden

** Keyboard shortcuts

  We need to implement all of the useful key shortcuts. These are:
    CTRL+SPACEBAR	Select column
    CTRL+A		Select all
    SHIFT+SPACEBAR	Select row
    Selection keys+CTRL	Extend selection to boundary of worksheet
    SHIFT+BACKSPACE	Collapse selection to active cell

    More...

* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

* Scrolling

** Scrollbar scrolling

* CORBA exporting

* Perl bindings.

* Display Engine

** item-edit

   This should be improved to use a cell rendering routine.
   which should be shared between item-grid and item-edit, to
   get life feedback on the result.

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:
   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert
     

* Cell selection

   It does not shrink.

* Format engine

   The format engine needs to support the following format styles:

   0.0;(0.0);"Zero";@
 
   That format has four regions separated by ";", they are:

	0.0    -- format for positive numbers
	(0.0)  -- format for negative numbers
	"Zero" -- format for the zero number
	@      -- format for anything else

   This default ordering can be modified if condition specifiers are
included, like this:

   [>10]0.0;[>0]"Bigger than zero"0;"None"

   If the *first* field includes the condition ([>10]), then the
default 4 components assumed is dropped, and then an arbitrary number
of conditional formats can be specified.  The last format is always
the default used in case none of the conditions match.

   In the above example:

   numbers bigger than 10 would get the format:
      0.0

   numbers bigger than 0 (but less than 10 as they would have matched
   the previous rule) get this format:

      "Bigger than zero"0 

   And the rest gets:

      "None"

Text can be included in a format with quotation marks:

     "X="0.0  would render 5.4 like this:   "X=5.4"

The use of the backslash should escape the next character (just like
quoting the next character).

** Color specification:

   After the condition specifier or at the beginning of the section if
no condition specifier exists, a color can be specified, like this:

   "[Blue]0.0"

   Or:

   "[>10000000][Blue]0.0;[<0][Red](0.0)"

** Special keywords:

   The "General" special keyword should just use the output of
sprintf "%g".  

** Day/Minute rules

"m"	      Shows the month as a number without any leading zeros (ie,
	      1..12).  If "m" is used inmediately after "h" or "hh" this should
	      render minutes instead of months.
   
"mm"	      Shows the month as a number with a leading zero if
	      required (01..12).  If "mm" is used inmediately after
	      "h" or "hh" this should render the minutes instead of a
	      month. 

"mmm"	      Shows the month as an abbreviation (Jan-Dic)

"mmmm"	      Shows the name as a full name (Jannuary-December)

"d"	      Shows the day number wihtout leading zeros (1..31)

"dd"	      Shows the day number with a leading zero (01..31)

"ddd"	      Shows the day name as an abbreviation (Sat..Sun)

"dddd"	      Shows the full day name (Saturday..Sunday)

"yy", "yyyy"  Shows the years as a number with two digits (00-99) or
	      as four digits (1900-2078).

"h" or "hh"   Shoes the hour with or without leading zeros.  if "AM"
	      or "PM" is present on the format the 12-hour clock is
	      used, otherwise the 24-hour clock is used.

"m" or "mm"   same for minutes 

"s" or "ss"   same for seconds.

AM/am/A/a     Shows the hour using th 12-hour clock.  Gnumerc should show
PM/pm/p/p     "AM", "am", "M" or "a" for the hours between midnight
	      and noon and "PM", "pm", "P" or "p" for the hours
	      between noon and midnight.

	      If no indicator is used, the hour should be displayed in
	      the 24-hour format.
