	This is not really a change note.  However, I wanted to point out that
	the 2nd limitation below is fixed now link functions are now called
	correctly.

2002-03-01  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* sample_datasource.c : Initial implementation of an external data
	  source.  The actual data source is quick and dirty, we just read
	  from a named pipe.  It is completely unsuitable for real work.  The
	  intent is to provide a test bed for the components necessary to
	  produce a data source.  Current architectural limitations include
	    - Although the source queues things correctly for recalc it does
	      not actually run the recalc yet.  We'll want to offer some
	      configurability for this.
	    - linking an expression from a plugin that has not yet been loaded
	      should activate.  Instead we don't activate until the first
	      evaluation.  This is not a major failing but it does mean that
	      _link functions are not called corerctly.
	    - The init/cleanup routines for plugins should have
	      CommandContexts to report errors.
	    - It would be nice to be able to add menu and toolbar entries.


	To use the source :
	    in a sheet atl_last(ticker)
	    and then cat > /tmp/atl
	    ticker:value
	    The on sheet value will only change on the _next_ user invoked
	    recalc.
