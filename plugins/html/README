This is a small and simple plugin to export and import HTML files.
It is published under the GNU GPL..

Features of the export/import functions:

	- exporting tables

		* all tables are written in one file, but every sheet
		  gets it's own TABLE-tag
		* beside the content of the cells it self the following
		  attributes are exported:
			- center and right horizontal alignment
			- vertical top alignment
			- background color
			- foreground color
			- bold font setting
			- italic font setting
		* the characters "<" and ">" are 7bit encoded

	- importing tables

		* this is just a dirty hack which will in the most
		  cases only work while reading html files which were
		  created by this plugin!
		* while reading the html file the following attributes
		  are imported:
			- bold font setting
			- italic font setting
			- horizontal center and right aligment
		* the 7bit presentation of "<" and ">" are decoded

There is also an experimental LaTeX mode for exporting tables.
It does not support colors and can not align to the center .. :-(
