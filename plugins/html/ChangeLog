2000-01-29  Jon K Hellan  <hellan@acm.org>

	Megacommit.

	The purpose of the changeset is twofold:

	1. Use CommandContexts for error reporting for file read/save.
	2. This allows us to let FileFormatOpen return 0 on success, -1 on
	   failure, same as FileFormatSave. The convention to return NULL
	   on success was highly ideosyncratic.

	* epsf.h (epsf_write_wb): Add CommandContext.

	(html_read): Return 0 on success, -1 on failure. Use
	gnumeric_error_read to report errors.
