 
	This code should cope with very simply Visual Basic macros
that do not make use of manipulating any sort of OLE2 object such
as Application, Workbook, Sheet etc. This leaves you only the built
in functions.

	To test the plugin try putting this in you home directory:

file: gnumeric.gbp

[snip]
Module=main; main.gba
Startup="Sub main"

[snip]

And:

file: main.gbp

[snip]
count As Integer

Sub Main ()
	MsgBox "Initializing the Basic module"
	count = 0
End Sub

Function getMain () As Integer
	count = count + 1
	getMain = count
End Function

[snip]

	NB. each file must end with a blank line; this is a feature.
