	* C/number_theory/bitand.xml: Added this file as well as its title.  The num theory stuff is fully documented!

2002-02-23  Kevin Breit  <mrproper@ximian.com>

	* C/number_theory/*.xml: Added a whole bunch of files.  I seem to be only missing one more function to write about.  Almost done, so the fun can start!

2002-02-22  Kevin Breit  <mrproper@ximian.com>

	* C/funct-ref.xml: Added the remaining entities to the document.  The files don't exactly...exist right now.  So this document won't build.  I was just sick of adding entities.  I'll have these files in CVS in the next day or two.

	* C/funct-ref.xml: I added the ithprime function to the documentation.

	* C/number_theory: I added this directory.  This is where the function files go.

	* C/number_theory/*xml: I added all these files.  These are the XML files that are called from the funct_ref.xml file.
	
	* C/funct-ref.xml: I hacked this file a bit.  I'm going to split this into individual files shortly.

	* C/funct-ref.xml: Added this file to CVS.  It's going to be a test bed for our exciting new documentation platform for Gnome 2.
