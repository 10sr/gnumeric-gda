	* gnumeric_startup.scm (home-gnumericrc): We change the location of the home
	  gnumericrc to $HOME/.gnumerc/guile.scm

1999-12-18  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* functions.scm: THe formula redefinitions for sign, lcm and gcd were commented.
	  It is almost useless to redefine them on Scheme since C version are faster.
	  However, for example purposes I leave them commented.

	* galway_startup.scm: We no longer display Guile initialization messages.

1999-12-10  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* plugin.c: (value_to_scm) We now handle the VALUE_ARRAY case passing the value
	  as a scheme list by consing the elements of the list.

1999-12-10  Michael Meeks  <mmeeks@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: Fixup guile install.

1999-12-10  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* plugin.c: (expr_to_scm) The OPER_PERCENT case was included.

1999-12-09  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* plugin.c: We now include guile/gh.h so we can transform from doubles to scm numbers.
	  (value_to_scm): In VALUE_INTEGER we now use gh_double2scm to pass the double unto
	  scheme. In this way we remove the bug that crashed gnumeric when we passed a rational number.

	* functions.scm: (test) A test function was added. Since it's only created for hacking purposes
	  'tis commented.

1999-12-08  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* plugin.c: (func_marshal_func) We now use func_def_count_arg to get the count 
          number. Count variable was replaced with min and max int vars. 
          (scm_to_value): The float cast when returning a number was replaced
          with a float_t cast as per Michael's recomendation.

1999-12-07  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* functions.scm: The function fibonacci was corrected so it can always return numbers.
	
	* plugin.c: (scm_to_value) : Whenever VALUE type is a number we return a float.
	  This removes some gnumeric crashes due to the fact that scm int may be in some
	  cases bigger than C integers.

1999-12-05  Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net>

	* Makefile.am: Modified to include functions.scm
	
	* gnumeric_startup.scm: We now load the scheme
          functions from the new file functions.scm

	* functions.scm: The guile functions and their 
          registration are now located in this file.
          (=FIBO(num)): Added fibonacci formula.
	
1999-11-28  Jody Goldberg <jgoldberg@home.com>

	* plugin.c (value_to_scm) : Fill in the missing enums.
	(scm_cell_value) : Use global eval_pos EvaluationPosition set on
	  a per function call basis rather than some cheesy global workbook
	  variable.
	(scm_cell_expr) : Ditto.
	(scm_set_cell_string) : Ditto.
	(scm_gnumeric_funcall) : Ditto.
	(func_marshal_func) : Create an implicit stack of eval_pos.
	(init_plugin) : Init the eval_pos kludge.
