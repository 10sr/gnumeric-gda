	* functions.scm: The function fibonacci was corrected so it can always return numbers.
	
	* plugin.c: (scm_to_value) : Whenever VALUE type is a number we return a float.
	  This removes some gnumeric crashes due to the fact that scm int may be in some
	  cases bigger than C integers.

	* Makefile.am: Modified to include functions.scm
	
	* gnumeric_startup.scm: We now load the scheme
          functions from the new file functions.scm

	* functions.scm: The guile functions and their 
          registration are now located in this file.
          (=FIBO(num)): Added fibonacci formula.

	(scm_cell_value) : Use global eval_pos EvaluationPosition set on
	  a per function call basis rather than some cheesy global workbook
	  variable.
	(scm_cell_expr) : Ditto.
	(scm_set_cell_string) : Ditto.
	(scm_gnumeric_funcall) : Ditto.
	(func_marshal_func) : Create an implicit stack of eval_pos.
	(init_plugin) : Init the eval_pos kludge.
