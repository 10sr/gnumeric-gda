Michael
	* In ms-formula-write.c

		* Sort out silly things with massive sized sheets
			* Deeper DBCELL records
			* Truncated Index records
			* Intelligent blank cell removal on insertion.
	* Split panes.
	* Use same XML as Office 2000 for elegance (?)
	* Investigate VB streams, and their lengths.
	* Styles - special 'merge' only for visible parts of blank cells...
	* Re-write string / text get to
		a) homgenize namespace to 'biff_text'
		b) deal with continues elegantly ( lots of work )
		c) split header recognition code out
		d) give correct RT & unicode support ( waiting on gtk+ )
	* Re-write BiffQuery structure to allow better string
	support and to provide a generic sensible sub-query offset.
	* Fix VLookup so the lookfuns.xls works.
	* Fix INDEX, AREAS, INDIRECT.
	* Implement R1C1 style references.
	* hack ms-biff.c to kill CONTINUE handling.

Jody
	* Check the record lengths on the biff records BEFORE use.
	* More version size changes for NAME
	* ExternSheet import for pre-biff8
	* Save Array formulas
	* Keep probing XL colour indicies for more info on relationship
	  for 64, 65 and the background colour in WINDOW2.  It appears to
	  override the grid line colour and possibly the contrast nature
	  of 64.  What does 65 become then ?
	* Map bottom & right borders to top and left.

Frank
