	* corba-application.c : move init into a 'general' service so that
	  things do not complain.

	* New module to re-enable a CORBA interface in a plugin now that it is
	  possible to do it without making a mess in the core.  Untested and
	  many methods are incomplete but the frame work is mostly in place.
