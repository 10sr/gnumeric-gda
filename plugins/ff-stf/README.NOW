Hello,

The files in this directory (gnumeric/plugins/ff-stf) should no longer be used or worked on, they represent and early version of the STF (Text File Import).

The new STF has been merged into the gnumeric core and can be found in gnumeric/src/ and will be available to you automatically as "Text File import" in the Import dialog.

So, please, don't try to compile, use or modify this code!

Thanks,

Almer. S. Tigelaar.
