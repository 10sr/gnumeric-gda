	* dialog-stf-format-page.c (format_page_set_col_formatting):
	kill bug #5718: a C++ comment changed to a C style comment for
	compatability with non-gcc compilers.

	* dialog-stf.c (dialog_stf): Return -1 on cancel, 0 otherwise.

	Megacommit.

	The purpose of the changeset is twofold:

	1. Use CommandContexts for error reporting for file read/save.
	2. This allows us to let FileFormatOpen return 0 on success, -1 on
	   failure, same as FileFormatSave. The convention to return NULL
	   on success was highly ideosyncratic.

	* dialog-stf.h: Add CommandContext. Return int.

	* dialog-stf.c (dialog_stf) : Add CommandContext. Return 0 on success,
	-1 on failure. Use gnumeric_error_read to report errors.

	* stf.c (stf_read_workbook): Ditto.

	* stf-separated.c, stf-fixed.c :
	If a file's last line has _no_ line terminator but instead ends 
	with a \0 both the fixed and separated parse functions would skip
	over this \0 and continue parsing past the buffer, this is fixed
	now.

	* dialog-stf.c :
	Pressing the Back button on the main page would result in a 
	Page Cycle Error from the STF and another error from the Druid.
	Fixed.

	* stf.c : 
	No more memory mapping is done, this caused portability problems 
	and is now replaced with read and a dynamically allocated buffer.

	* stf.c :
	Added a check (stf_is_valid_input_data) which will check the data 
	and see if it _really_ is a valid text file/valid input data.
	
	* stf-util.c, stf-util.h, stf-fixed.c, stf-separated.c : 
	References to the overkill (stf_is_line_terminator) function have 
	been replaced by *buffer != '\n'.

	* dialog-stf-csv-page.c :
	Attached a new signal to the Custom Checkbutton on the Separation 
	Customization page so that the text widget next to it will do nice 
	stuff like changing sensitivity and auto focus.

	* dialog-stf-csv-page.c :
	Added some gnome style headers 
	they weren't all there yet
	
	* stf-preview.c:
	Made the column headers in the preview gray to make them more 
	distinguishable from the cells that contain data.

	* stf.c (init_plugin): Renamed to be more obvious
