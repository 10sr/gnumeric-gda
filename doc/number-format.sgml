  <title>Cell Formatting</title>

  <para>Cell formats allow you to change the way cell data appears in the 
    spreadsheet. It is important to keep in mind that it only alters the way the 
    data is presented, and does not change the value of the data. </para>
  
  <para>The formatting options allows for monetary units, scientific options,
     dates, times, fractions,and more. Positive and negative values can have different colors and formats
    for aiding in keeping track of values. There are also a large variety of
    date and time formats for virtually any time and date format one can think of.
    </para>
    
  <para>To change the formatting style for a cell or a range of cells,
    you only need to select the range of cells (see <xref linkend="editing-selections">)
      where you want to
      apply/change the format and then select from the
      <guimenu>Format</guimenu>/<guimenuitem>Cells</guimenuitem>/Numbers menu 
      (or from the context sensitive popup menu
      bound to the right mouse button) the appropriate format.</para>
  
  <para>Gnumeric provides a wide range of predetermined formatting
    styles.  These formatting styles are shown by category in the
    Cell/Style dialog box.  Just choose one of the display formats and
    accept the changes to change the display format for your
    cells.</para>
  
  <para>If none of the predetermined formatting styles fits your
    needs, you can define your own number formatting style by using a
    custom formatting expression: the custom formatting expressions give
    you more flexibility in number display.</para>

  <title>The Format Dialog</title>

  <para>The number formatting dialog (see <xref linkend="number-format-dialog"> ) 
      provides a wide range of options for 
      formatting numbers. The primary use of the dialog is to select from
      one of the many preset number formatting rules. These formatting styles
      should be more than adequate for the vast majority of cases. If none
      of these meet the needs of the user, it is possible to create your own
      formats. </para>
