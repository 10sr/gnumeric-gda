  <title>Autofill</title>
  
  <para>When dealing with spreadsheets it's pretty typical to want to
    add a set of cells that contain a series of numbers or dates or other
    values. While this can be done by hand, Gnumeric implements an autofill
    option to allow these sorts of series to be easily fill in.</para>
  

  <para>A typical example of when you want to use this feature is to fill
    a series of numbers maybe a list of part numbers, or a perhaps a list
    of TV channels. To create a list like this, all the user needs to do
    is to enter the first number into a cell and click on the autofill
    cursor in the bottom right corner of the cell border and drag it in
    the direction to fill. If the first cell contains a '1', for example,
    dragging the autofill button(see <xref linkend="celltobautofilled">) down three or four cells
      will fill the cells with 1,2,3,4 automatically.(see <xref linkend="cellsautofilled">)</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Select the cell that marks the beginning of the 
	area to autofill</para></listitem>
    
    <listitem><para>Enter the starting value into this cell</para></listitem>
    
    <listitem><para>Click the small rectangle in the bottom right corner
	of the first cell, and drag it to the end of the area to fill.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Release the mouse button. The cells in the selected area should
	now be field with autofilled values</para></listitem>

  <para>As handy as being able to simply and quickly generate series of
    numbers incremented by one, autofill can do much much more. The next simplest
    example is autofilling with a series with an increment other than 1. For example,
    to create a series that consist of odd numbers starting at 11, just enter 11 into
    a cell and 13 into the next cell. Then select both cells, and stretch it to the
    cover the cells to be filled. If you select the next 5 cells for example, it will
    fill with values 11,13,15,17,19,21,23. See <xref linkend="seedcellautofillsequence">
      and  <xref linkend="autofillsequence"> for example.</para>

    <title>Filling with Dates</title>
    
    <para>Oh, but numbers are easy you say! The real painful stuff is entering
      in cell by cell dates and times and other info. But never fear, Gnumeric is there
      to help you. Gnumeric has the ability to autofill dates, months, days of the week,
      and more. </para>
    
   <para> For an example, think of a typical business invoice, where everything is
      logged by the month. So it is quite typically to want to fill a series of cells
      with the months of the year in order. To do this is quite simple, essentially the
      same steps as making a numerical fill.</para>
    
    <para>Starting from cell B2 for example, if you want to fill the next 12 cells
      with the months, just enter the string "January" in B2. Then, click the fill button
      and stretch it over the next 12 cells, and release. Simple as that. See <xref
	linkend="datefillseed">, <xref linkend="datebeingfilled">, and 
	  <xref linkend="cellsfilled">. </para>

    <para> Other examples of strings that can be autofilled include days of
      the week (Monday, Tuesday,...), short weekdays (Mon, Tues, ....),
      short months (Jan, Feb,...) </para>

    <title>String And Number autofill</title>
    
    <para>Gnumeric tries to be intelligent about autofilling number values that
      embedded into text strings. So its possible to autofill cells with values
      like "9 lives to live","8 lives to live", etc. </para>

    <title>Formula autofill</title>
    
    <para>Probably the most useful of all the autofill capabilities is
      the abilty to autofill functions. In practice it works essentials the
      same as all the other autofill methods, it just transfers the functions
      of course. </para>
