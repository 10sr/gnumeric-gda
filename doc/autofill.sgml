<title>Autofill</title>

   <para>When dealing with spreadsheets it's pretty typical to want to
   add a set of cells that contain a series of numbers or dates or other
   values. While this can be done by hand, Gnumeric implements an autofill
   option to allow these sorts of series to be easily fill in.</para>


  <para>A typical example of when you want to use this feature is to fill
  a series of numbers maybe a list of part numbers, or a perhaps a list
  of TV channels. To create a list like this, all the user needs to do
  is to enter the first number into a cell and click on the autofill
  cursor in the bottom right corner of the cell border and drag it in
  the direction to fill. If the first cell contains a '1', for example,
  dragging the autofill button(see figure 1), down three or four cells
  will fill the cells with 1,2,3,4 automatically.(see figure 2)</para>

  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Select the cell that marks the begining of the 
     area to autofill</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Enter the starting value into this cell</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Click the small rectangle in the bottom right corner
     of the first cell, and drag it to the end of the area to fill.</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Release the mouse button. The cells in the selected area should
     nwo be field with autofilled values</para></listitem>

  <para>As handy as being able to simply and quickly generate series of
  numbers incremented by one, autofill can do much much more. The next simplest
  example is autofilling with a series with an increment other than 1. For example,
 to create a series that consist of odd numbers starting at 11, just enter 11 into
 a cell and 13 into the next cell. Then select both cells, and stretch it to the
 cover the cells to be filled. If you select the next 5 cells for example, it will
 fill with values 11,13,15,17,19,21,23. See figures 3 and 4 for example.</para>

   <title>Filling with Dates</title>

   <para>Oh, but numbers are easy you say! The real painful stuff is entering
   in cell by cell dates and times and other info. But never fear, Gnumeric is there
   to help you. Gnumeric has the ability to autofill dates, months, days of the week,
   and more. </para>

   <para> For an example, think of a typical business invoice, where everything is
   logged by the month. So it is quite typically to want to fill a series of cells
   with the months of the year in order. To do this is quite simple, essentially the
   same steps as making a numerical fill.</para>

   <para>Starting from cell B2 for example, if you want to fill the next 12 cells
   with the months, just enter the string "January" in B2. Then, click the fill button
   and stretch it over the next 12 cells, and release. Simple as that. See Figures 5 and
   6. </para>

   <para> Other examples of strings that can be autofilled include days of
   the week (Monday, Tuesday,...), short weekdays (Mon, Tues, ....),
   short months (Jan, Feb,...) </para>

   <title>String And Number autofill</title>

   <para>Gnumeric tries to be intelligent about autofilling number values that
   embedded into text strings. So its possible to autofill cells with values
   like "9 lives to live","8 lives to live", etc. </para>

   <para>See Figure 8 for some contrived examples.</para>

  <title>Formula autofill</title>
 
  <para>Probabaly the most useful of all the autofill capabilties is
  the abilty to autofill functions. In practice it works essentialy the
  same as all the other autofill methods, it just transfers the funtions
  of course. </para>

  <para>See Figures  9 and 10 for a simple example.</para>
