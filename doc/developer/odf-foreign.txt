Due to the limitations of the ODF file format we occasionally add foreign elements and attributes to those files. This text documents those elements and attributes.

1) Elements and attributes added by goffice:

gnm:format-magic
An attribute to <number:time-style> and <number:date-style> to specify Gnumeric's magic number for the style. The magic number is stored as an integer. When ever we set this attribute we also set the number:source attribute to language. On import we only use this magic number if the number:source attribute is still set to language, since otherwise somebody will have edited the format.

gnm:truncate-on-overflow
An attribute to <number:hours>, <number:minutes> and <number:seconds>. An attribute value of "false" indicates that this item is not restricted to its natural range and so is used for elapsed time. This attribute defaults to "true". Note that ODF has the attribute number:truncate-on-overflow of the <number:time-style> with a similar effect, but with unclear specification to which element it applies. For an element where gnm:truncate-on-overflow is not set, number:truncate-on-overflow applies.

gnm:max-denominator-digits
An attribute to <number:fraction> giving the maximum number of denominator digits to be used.

gnm:no-integer-part
An attribute to <number:fraction> determining whether an integer portion is shown or not. Defaults to "false" (i.e. an integer part is shown.)

gnm:engineering
An attribute to <number:scientific-number>. A value of "true" indicates that the exponent will always be a multiple of 3.


2) Elements and attributes added by Gnumeric:

gnm:border-line-style-top
gnm:border-line-style-bottom
gnm:border-line-style-left
gnm:border-line-style-right
gnm:diagonal-bl-tr-line-style
gnm:diagonal-tl-br-line-style
These are attributes of the <style:table-cell-properties> giving the Gnumeric code for the appropriate border as created by odf_get_gnm_border_format.

gnm:GnmVAlign
An attribute of the <style:table-cell-properties> adding to the "automatic" value of style:vertical-align. Possible values are any GnmVAlign enumeration values other than VALIGN_TOP, VALIGN_BOTTOM, VALIGN_CENTER

gnm:GnmHAlign
An attribute of the <style:paragraph-properties> clarifying the "start" value of style:text-align. Possible values are any GnmHAlign enumeration values other than HALIGN_LEFT, HALIGN_RIGHT, HALIGN_CENTER, HALIGN_JUSTIFY 

gnm:input-title
gnm:input-msg
These are attributes of the <style:table-cell-properties> giving the input title and the input message  [These are currently ignored on import.]

gnm:outliers
gnm:radius-ratio
These are attributes for the plot-style gnm:box

gnm:default-separation
This is an attribute for the plot-style chart:circle

3) Plot Styles added by Gnumeric:

gnm:box
gnm:scatter-color
gnm:xyz-surface
gnm:polar
