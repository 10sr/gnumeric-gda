Adding formulas to gnumeric using the guile plugin
--------------------------------------------------

Ariel Rios <ariel@arcavia.com>

This paper will introduce the guile plugin as a convenient,
efficient and easy way to adding formulas unto gnumeric.

Function tokens used in Gnumeric

NOTE: Please refer to the writing-functions.sgml for
a complete reference.

f : A floating point (double) value.
s : A string (char*)
b : A boolean
r : A Range eg. A1:A5 - See 'A'
a : An Array eg. {1,2,3;4,5,6} ( a 3x2 array ) - See 'A'
A : Either an Array or a Range: Use the
    value_area set of functions to simplify the code.
    see expr.h.
? : Any type, the type must be checked from value->type.   
| : This designates that the arguments in the token string
    following this character are optional.

Although scheme makes no difference in data types, we must know
what kind of data we are getting from gnumeric so we can use it
accordingly.

The next table will show the data types we are expecting:

f : (double) => number (big, integer, rational)
s : (char *) => string
b : (bool)   => scheme bool (#t #f)
r : (range)  => scheme list
a : (array)  => scheme list
| : (optional => correspond to scheme dot inside a lambda defintion

3. Adding formulas unto gnumeric.

Adding formulas unto gnumeric is very easy. 

First you need to create a new scheme file named guile.scm
and copy it on your HOME .gnumeric directory.

Inside the file you will need to register the scheme functions you will
want to register. The registration is done via the register-function 
procedure:

(register-function
 name
 arg
 description
 function)

name => New formula will be registered using this string.

"sign"

arg => String that includes the combination of arguments to be passed
       by the gnumeric formula
"f"

description=> Description of the new formula.

"@FUNCTION=SIGN
@SYNTAX=SIGN(number)
@DESCRIPTION=Returns -1 if NUMBER is less than 0, 1 if NUMBER
is greater than 0 and 0 if NUMBER is equal 0."

function => The scheme function. Please note that the number of arguments
            of function shall be the same as the arguments given in arg.

4. Example:

The following is the registration of the fibonacci function.
This function is already included on the gnumeric distribution.

;;fibonacci function
;;Usage: =FIBO(number)
;;Calculates the fibonacci number of number.

;; A fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding numbers
;; in the fibonacci series:

;; (fibonacci 0) => 0
;; (fibonacci 1) => 1
;; (fibonacci 2) => 1
;; (fibonacci 3) => 2
;; (fibonacci 4) => 3
;; (fibonacci 20) => 6765
;; (fibonacci 30) => 832040

(define (fibo n)   
  (letrec ((fibof
            (lambda (n a b)
             (if (<= n 2)
                 b
                 (fibof (- n 1) b (+ a b))))))

    (fibof n 1 1)))


(register-function
"fibo" "f"
"@FUNCTION=FIBO
@SYNTAX=FIBO(num) 
@DESCRIPTION=Returns the fibonnacci computation for number."
fibo)

You are now able to use you newly designed formula with:
=FIBO(number)
