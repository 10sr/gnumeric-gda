<section>Copying and moving cells</section>

There are two ways of moving and copying cells in Gnumeric:

	<item>Using copy/cut/paste operations</item>
	<item>Using the mouse to drag the selection</item>

<subsection>Using the mouse to drag the selection</subsection>

Dragging the border of a selection to a target area will move the
cells. 

Dragging the border of a selection to a target area while holding the
control key down will perform a move.

If you use the right button for performing the drag, a menu with the
possible options appears when you release it.
