  <title>Copying and moving cells</title>
  
  <para>There are two ways of moving and copying cells in Gnumeric:</para>

  <sect2>Using the mouse to drag the selection
    
	<para>Gnumeric allows the user to move and copy cells
	 and their contents by simply dragging and dropping the
	 cell to its new location. </para>

 
	<para>The basic procedure to quickly drag and drop a cell to
        a new location is to click on the border, and drag the cell
        to its new location and release. The contents of the cell
       will be moved to the new cell.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Click (MB1) on the border (anywhere, except the autofill square in
        the bottom right corner). Ctrl+click copies the cell, why a plain
        click just moves the cell.</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Drag the cell to the new cell location.</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Release the selection.</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>This is the simplest method and most common use the drag and drop
  cell moving and copying. The keybindings give you a good set of options
  for quick moving and copying.</para>
 </sect2>


<sect2>
    <title>Right Click Options</title>

  <para>The other more extensive option to moving and copying cells is the 
  right click options. This presents a menu of options that is more extensive
  that can be easily done with the normal keybindings</para>

<itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Right Click (MB3) on the border (anywhere, except the autofill square in
     the bottom right corner).</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Drag the cell to the new cell location.</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Release the selection. An options menu should pop-up.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Select the appropriate option from the menu and click again. The new
    cell should have the new info.</para></listitem>

      moves the value, the format, and the formula. Equilivent to MB1.</para></listitem>

     includes number format, color, font, filltype, etc.</para></listitem>

  <title>Editing cells using the selection</title>
  
  <para>There are various ways of using the selection to ease the
    edition of the cells in the spreadhsheet. </para>

  <para>For instance, given a selection of cells (contiguous, or
     non-contiguous), data can be entered.  THe enter key will accept
     the data and move the cursor to the next cell in the selection
     down the selection.  The tab on the other hand key will move the
     cursor to the rightmost cell (or it will scroll if you have
     reached the edge of the selection).</para>

  <para>Control-Enter does the inverser of Enter (it moves to the
     previous cell in the selection, moving towards the top), while
     control-tab moves the cursor to the left.</para>

<sect2>

  <title>Simple Selections</title>
 
  <para>The active cell is indicated by a dark double line with a small
   square in the bottom right corner. The active cell is the the one 
   that is currently in focus and will take any input for the keyboard.</para>

   over the cell and press the MB1.</para>

  <title>Selecting multiple cells</title>

  <para>A selection of multiple cells is indicated by a dark double line around
  the extents of the selection. The top-left cell appears much like a single
  selected cell while the rest of the selection is the inverse color.</para>

 <para>To make a continuous selection of cells, click on the cell with
 the white_cross cursor and drag the extents of the selection until
 it comprises the area you wish to select, and release.</para>

 use ctrl+click and drag to argument an existing selection. 
 The cells can be added individually or as parts of other selections.</para>

 <title>Keyboard Shortcuts</title>
 
 <para>The quickest way to make large selections, especially when your 
 already using the keyboard is to just use the keyboard selection tools.
 The basic use is to press Shift+arrow keys to make a new selection.</para>

 <para>To select an entire row of cells, press Shift+space. This is eqilivent
 to pressing the row label button on the left side of the sheet.</para>

 <title>Filling a region with the same text or value.</title>
 <para> For a set of cells that need to get filled with the same value,
 the easiest way is to make a selection using one of the above mentioned, then
 enter the value into one of the cells like normal, but instead of pressing
 enter, press Ctrl+enter instead. The selection will fill with the value entered 
 for that cell.</para>

 <para>For cases where you want to fill with number sequences, or dates, or other 
 sorted data, you may want to use the autofill option.</para>

<title>Autofill</title>

   <para>When dealing with spreadsheets it's pretty typical to want to
   add a set of cells that contain a series of numbers or dates or other
   values. While this can be done by hand, Gnumeric implements an autofill
   option to allow these sorts of series to be easily fill in.</para>


  <para>A typical example of when you want to use this feature is to fill
  a series of numbers maybe a list of part numbers, or a perhaps a list
  of TV channels. To create a list like this, all the user needs to do
  is to enter the first number into a cell and click on the autofill
  cursor in the bottom right corner of the cell border and drag it in
  the direction to fill. If the first cell contains a '1', for example,
  dragging the autofill button(see figure 1), down three or four cells
  will fill the cells with 1,2,3,4 automatically.(see figure 2)</para>

  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Select the cell that marks the begining of the 
     area to autofill</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Enter the starting value into this cell</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Click the small rectangle in the bottom right corner
     of the first cell, and drag it to the end of the area to fill.</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>Release the mouse button. The cells in the selected area should
     nwo be field with autofilled values</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>As handy as being able to simply and quickly generate series of
  numbers incremented by one, autofill can do much much more. The next simplest
  example is autofilling with a series with an increment other than 1. For example,
 to create a series that consist of odd numbers starting at 11, just enter 11 into
 a cell and 13 into the next cell. Then select both cells, and stretch it to the
 cover the cells to be filled. If you select the next 5 cells for example, it will
 fill with values 11,13,15,17,19,21,23. See figures 3 and 4 for example.</para>

   <title>Filling with Dates</title>

   <para>Oh, but numbers are easy you say! The real painful stuff is entering
   in cell by cell dates and times and other info. But never fear, Gnumeric is there
   to help you. Gnumeric has the ability to autofill dates, months, days of the week,
   and more. </para>

   <para> For an example, think of a typical business invoice, where everything is
   logged by the month. So it is quite typically to want to fill a series of cells
   with the months of the year in order. To do this is quite simple, essentially the
   same steps as making a numerical fill.</para>

   <para>Starting from cell B2 for example, if you want to fill the next 12 cells
   with the months, just enter the string "January" in B2. Then, click the fill button
   and stretch it over the next 12 cells, and release. Simple as that. See Figures 5 and
   6. </para>

   <para> Other examples of strings that can be autofilled include days of
   the week (Monday, Tuesday,...), short weekdays (Mon, Tues, ....),
   short months (Jan, Feb,...) </para>

   <sect2>
   <title>String And Number autofill</title>

   <para>Gnumeric tries to be intelligent about autofilling number values that
   embedded into text strings. So its possible to autofill cells with values
   like "9 lives to live","8 lives to live", etc. </para>

   <para>See Figure 8 for some contrived examples.</para>

  <title>Formula autofill</title>
 
  <para>Probabaly the most useful of all the autofill capabilties is
  the abilty to autofill functions. In practice it works essentialy the
  same as all the other autofill methods, it just transfers the funtions
  of course. </para>

  <para>See Figures  9 and 10 for a simple example.</para>
