  <title>Formulas</title>
  
  <para>Formulas are the key to the whole ball of wax when it comes to
    spreadsheets. A formula can take almost anything as its arguments
    including single numbers, cell references, ranges of cells, arrays
    of cells, etc. </para>

    <title>Syntax</title>
    
    <para> Formulas are distinguished from regular data by a '=' as
      the first character. Everything following a '=' is evaluated as
      a formula, not a string. </para>
    
    <para> The simplest fomula's just use the standard math operator
     and symbols. +,-,*,/ are intrepreted just as you would expect
     them to.  +,- can be used as unary operators and indicate sign,
     just as can be expected.</para>

    <title>Using Functions</title>
    
    <para>Most of the standard math, business, statistical, and
      scientific calculations are implemented in terms of
      functions. Functions are in the form of:</para>
