Function: AND

Syntax:   AND(b1, b2, ...)

Implements the logical AND function: the result is TRUE if all of the
expression evaluate to TRUE, otherwise it returns FALSE.

b1, trough bN are expressions that should evaluate to TRUE or FALSE.
If an integer or floating point value is provided zero is considered
FALSE and anything else is TRUE.

If the values contain strings or empty cells those values are
ignored.  If no logical values are provided, then the error '#VALUE!'
is returned.
