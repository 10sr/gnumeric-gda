  <title>How to report a problem</title>

  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> is a complex computer program
    and therefore necessarily contains some mistakes. These are called
    "bugs" after one of the earliest errors in very old machines which
    was actually caused by an insect entering the machine and
    preventing a switch from closing. The
    <application>Gnumeric</application> team is keenly interested in
    finding these errors and correcting them. Please, help us to fix
    these errors by telling us about them. Often the mistake is
    obvious and a fix can be made immediately to be included in the
    very next release of <application>Gnumeric</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The <application>Gnumeric</application> project uses a world wide
    web system called <application>Bugzilla</application> to collect
    reports of program errors and then to track these errors until
    they are finally fixed. This process is quite simple and can be
    completed in just a few steps. For more detailed instructions,
    GNOME's bugzilla can be found at <ulink type="http"
    url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">
<verbatim>
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ 
</verbatim>
    </ulink> and instructions can be found at <ulink type="http"

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-understand">
    <title>Understanding the error</title>

    <para>
      The most critical step is understanding the error as well as
      possible. This requires knowing clearly what was happening
      before the error occurred, what specifically caused the error to
      occur, what the error condition is and what happened as a
      consequence of the error. The most helpful situation to enable
      the developers to find and correct the error is to come up with
      a sequence of steps that generate the error. If the error can be
      repeated, it can almost always be corrected. The most helpful
      error reports include a small recipe that can cause the error.
    </para>

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-bugzilla_access">
    <title>Accessing the GNOME project's bugzilla</title>

    <para>
      There are several ways to file a bug report through
      bugzilla. One of the entries in the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu
      is called <guimenuitem>Report a Problem</guimenuitem>. This menu
      entry should cause a browser window to launch and open the
      <application>Gnumeric</application> bugzilla page. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Alternatively users can access gnumeric's page of bugzilla by
      visiting the <application>Gnumeric</application> <ulink type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric">
      bug entry page</ulink> which is located at the 
<verbatim>
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric
</verbatim> URL.
    </para>

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-bugzilla_account">
    <title>Opening a bugzilla account</title>

    <para>
      The first time a user uses bugzilla, they must create an
      account. This account is needed to allow users to be informed of
      the status of the bug as it is tracked by the system from
      submission to resolution. The only requirement for opening a
      bugzilla account is the possession of a valid email address
      through which the user can receive a password. Users who have
      not previously logged into bugzilla and had the browser they are
      using accept a cookie are automatically redirected to a login
      page which has a link called "create a new account" which will
      direct users to the account creation page.
    </para>

    <para>
      Alternative, by clicking on this <ulink type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/createaccount.cgi">link</ulink>,
      users can follow a shortcut directly to the account creation
      page.
    </para>

    <para>
      Creating a new account is very simple. The account creation page
      has two fields. In the first, a valid email account must be
      given. The second asks for a name that the users wishes to be
      known by but this name can be anything. After a user fills out
      these two fields, clicking on the button labelled "Create
      Account" will cause a new account to be created and an email
      sent to the address given in the email field. The email will
      contain the password used to identify this user.
    </para>

    <para>
      After creating an account, users can visit the <ulink
      type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric">
      <application>Gnumeric</application> bug entry page</ulink>. Here
      users are asked to login with their email address and
      password. After logging in, bugzilla will present a page to add
      a bug report.
   </para>

   <note>
     <para>
       A user who accepts cookes from bugzilla.gnome.org will only
       have to give a password the first time they visit GNOME's
       bugzilla. During all future visits, GNOME will recognize the
       cookie and therefore identify the user.

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-report">
    <title>Filing a bug report through bugzilla</title>

    <para>
      The <application>Gnumeric</application> bug entry page consists
      of several fields many of which must be filled out to provide a
      useful bug report. The most important of these will be the "Bug
      Description" which contains both the brief "Summary" which acts
      like an email subject line and the detailled description which
      describes step by step how to reproduce the bug. The remaining
      fields provide extra information which may help resolve the
      problem.
    </para>


    <sect3 id="sect-bugs-report-description">
      <title>The Bug Description</title>

      <para>
        A useful error report will include a subject that describes
        the error concisely, has a brief introduction which explains
        in greater detail what happened and, ideally, has a small
        recipe that leads to the error being repeated.
      </para>

      <para>
        The summary field, like the subject of an email message,
        briefly describes the problem. For example, a useful error
        report might have a summary "Gnumeric crashes when saving a
        file".
      </para>

      <para>
        The field titled "Steps to reproduce the bug" should contain a
        slightly expanded version of the summary giving an overview of
        the problem and then give a step-by-step example of how to
        reproduce the problem. For example, this field could look like
        the following: 
<screen> 
This report describes an error which causes gnumeric to crash
during the use of the file save dialog.

1) Start a new gnumeric
2) In Cell A1 type "hello"
3) From the "File" menu, select "Save As"
=> The "Save As dialog" opens up
4) In the file name box, type "My spreadsheet is cool"
5) Click on the "Save" button
=> I expected the file to be saved, and to be able to keep
working but instead gnumeric disappeared and the file was 
never saved.

thanks, 
a user

        In order to submit the bug report into bugzilla, once all of

        button labeled "commit".
      </para>

      <para>
        Once the bug is committed, a bug report number for this bug
        will be assigned, and email will be sent either the the
        project maintainer or to one of the other developers which
        deal specifically with that component of the program. When
        others take an interest in the bug and add comments or
        solutions, email will be sent out to the user to inform them
        of the status of the bug until it is either dismissed or
        resolved. Bugs can be dismissed if they describe a behaviour
        that is expected or if they are not deemed important enough to
        fix.

      <para>
        A version of the bug entry page with most of the fields
        already filled out can be saved as a link and bookmarked for
        future use. This ability is only of use for developers or for
        users who have found a large number of bugs in one particular
        component of <application>Gnumeric</application>.
      </para>

      <para>
        To use this shortcut, first open a new bug report, then fill
        out only the fields that will apply to all the future bugs
        being reported and then click on the button labelled "Bookmark
        these values". Bugzilla will then construct a template and
        will provide a link which can be saved for future use just as
        any othe r page on the web can be saved as a bookmark. To use
        these values, simply clicking on the bookmark will open the
        <application>Gnumeric</application> with the common fields
        already filled out.
