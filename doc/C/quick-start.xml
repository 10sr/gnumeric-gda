    Unfortunately, this manual cannot teach you the very basics of
    interacting with a modern computer. If you have never used
    computers, don't know the names of the hardware components
    (the pieces you can touch) or don't know the names of the elements
    you see on the screen (like windows or the mouse pointer), you
    will probably want to get some basic advice from someone you know
    or read the manuals which came with your machine or your operating
    system. It's all pretty easy but, in order to understand this
    manual, you will kneed to know some basic terminology and have
    some basic computing skills. For an introduction to the GNOME
    desktop environment, see <ulink type="help"

  <title>Starting Gnumeric the First Time</title>

  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can be started in several ways
    depending on the type of desktop you have. All of these approaches
    result in a gnumeric window appearing on your monitor.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      It is assumed that you have installed the
      <application>Gnumeric</application> program on your
      machine. Installing <application>Gnumeric</application> depends
      on the particular operating system and distribution and is
      therefore beyond the scope of this manual. If
      <application>Gnumeric</application> is not installed on your
      machine, read the manuals that came with your distribution or
      look at your distribution vendor's website.

    If you are a GNOME user, you should have a `panel' somewhere on
    your desktop. This panel contains icons, and at least two menus.
    One of these menus is called <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> and
    has an icon which looks like the outline of a foot. If you click
    on this menu name, a menu will appear. Drag the cursor down to the
    <guisubmenu>Office</guisubmenu> sub-menu name, and a submenu will
    appear. Drag the cursor into the submenu and then release the
    mouse button when the cursor is on the entry which reads "Gnumeric
    Spreadsheet." This will start the program and the main window of
    <application>Gnumeric</application> will appear as shown in <xref
    linkend="fig-gnumeric-first-start" />

    If you use GNOME as part of a distribution, the "Application" menu
    may have a different name. In that case you should hunt around the
    menus until you find something named "Gnumeric" with the

    If you don't use GNOME, your desktop may have its own menus and
    you can try to find an entry which will start

  </para>

  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can also be started from the
    command line in an <application>xterm</application> window or
    equivalent terminal emulator. Open a terminal, and, at the shell
    prompt type: 
    <screen>
      gnumeric &amp;
    </screen>
   which will start the program and send it into the background.

    If you are still stuck, ask a friend or someone who knows your
    machine. Unfortunately, getting started is often the hardest part
    of learning to use a new program but it is also the one place a
    manual such as this one cannot really help.
  </para>

  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can also be opened using a
    spreadsheet file directly. If there is a spreadsheet file on the
    desktop or in a file manager like
    <application>Nautilus</application>, it may be possible to click
    or double-click with the mouse pointer on the file and have
    <application>Gnumeric</application> open the file automatically.

<sect1 id="quick-working-with-gnumeric">
  <title>Working with Gnumeric</title>

  <para>
    After opening, <application>Gnumeric</application> appears as was
    shown in <xref linkend="fig-gnumeric-first-start" />. The open
    application contains a menubar at the top, two toolbars below the
    menu bar, and below these, on the left, the object toolbar, and,
    on the right, the data entry area above the cell grid area which
    itself is above the list of worksheets and the information
    area. For a detailed explanation of each of these elements, see
    <xref linkend="sect-gui-overview" />.  By default,
    <application>Gnumeric</application> opens a workbook with three
    worksheets and a file name of <filename>Book1.gnumeric</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Using a spreadsheet generally involves several steps. First the
    application is started to obtain an empty workbook, which
    generally has several empty worksheets. Next, data and formulas
    are entered into one or several sheets. The data may be entered by
    hand or imported from external files. The formulas are generally
    entered by hand, possibly with the help of various tools. The data
    may be formatted to appear in particular ways and to clarify the
    structure of the data in the worksheet. A user may also create
    several graphical plots. Certain parts of the spreadsheets may be
    printed out as tables. The work is then usually saved into a file
    which can be re-opened later to add or modify the contents of the
    workbook.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      The terminology can be confusing. A spreadsheet file contains a
      workbook and possibly some other information about the
      file. (Because the workbook is far more important than the extra
      information, files are often called workbooks.) A workbook
      contains one or more worksheets. Each worksheet contains a lare
      number of cells usually arranged into a two dimensional grid
      made up of columns and rows.

<sect1 id="quick-commands">
  <title>Using Commands</title>

  <para>
    The commands provided by <application>Gnumeric</application> can
    be accessed using several methods. These methods are explained
    here. The most important commands are explained in the rest of
    this chapter. All of the commands are explained in later chapters
    of this manual.
  </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Using Menu Commands</title>
    <para>
      The menus provide the simplest way to get to all of the commands
      provided by <application>Gnumeric</application>. These menus
      work like those in any GNOME application: clicking on the menu
      name causes a menu to open, dragging the mouse cursor onto the
      menu and then releasing the mouse button (or clicking again)
      while the cursor is above a menu entry causes that command to be
      exectuted. For further information, see <xref
      linkend="sect-gui-menus"/>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Using Toolbar Button Commands</title>
    <para>
      The buttons on the toolbars are quite simple to use. Simply
      placing the mouse cursor above one of the buttons and pressing
      the left mouse button will perform the command, either directly
      or by opening a dialog window. For further information, see
      <xref linkend="sect-gui-toolbars"/>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Using Context Menu Commands</title>
    <para>
      In many situations, <application>Gnumeric</application> provides
      a menu right under the mouse cursor if the right hand mouse
      button is clicked. This menu contains different entries
      depending on the placement of the mouse cursor when the right
      hand mouse button is clicked. For further information, see <xref
      linkend="context-menu"/>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Using Keyboard Shortcut Commands</title>
    <para>
      Certain common commands can be triggered using a combination of
      keys. The menu entries are often followed by a combination of
      keys which can be used to trigger that command. For instance,
      saving the file which is currently being used can be performed
      by typing jointly the control key and the s key
      (i.e. <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>S</keysym></keycombo>).

<sect1 id="quick-data">
  <title>Data in Gnumeric</title>

  <para>
    The main purpose of spreadsheets like
    <application>Gnumeric</application> is to collect information in a
    coherent manner, perform calculations on the information and then
    be able to update those calculations easily if the original
    numbers change. The use of a spreadsheet therefore requires a
    substantial understanding of the types of information which can be
    entered into the spreadsheet and the methods which can be used to
    manipulate that information. This section explains how data can be
    used in <application>Gnumeric</application>.
  </para>

    <sect2>
    <title>The Types of Data in a Spreadsheet</title>

    <para>
      Spreadsheets like <application>Gnumeric</application> treat
      information by separating the data into separate cells and
      considering the data in each cell to be separate elements. Each
      cell in the spreadsheet has both a value, which is what
      <application>Gnumeric</application> manipulates, and a
      representation, which is what is actually shown. Understanding
      this distinction is complicated and make take the new user some
      time. This distinction is one of the reasons spreadsheets are so
      useful.
    </para>

    <para>
      The cells of the spreadsheet are contained in the cell grid
      area. The cell grid area is the area with a white background and
      grey grid lines. The grid lines separate this area into separate
      cells. Each cell has a unique reference name which is the
      combination of the letters of the name of the column and the
      number of the row. For instance, the top, leftmost cell is the
      cell named "A1" and the cell two over to the right and four rows
      down is named "C4" because it is in the column labelled "C" and
      in the fourth row. Each of these cells can contain only one
      single datum.
    </para>

    <para>
      The datum contained in any cell will have one of five types: a
      text string type, a number type, a formula type, a boolean type
      or an error type. These five types of data values can then have
      various display formats so that, for instance, a number value
      can be displayed as a number, a monetary amount, a date or a
      time. Text strings are sequences of characters and punctuation
      marks and could, for example, contain textual information such
      as peoples names. Number values are simply numbers but may be
      input and displayed in various formats including decimal
      numbers, dates, times, and numbers in scientific
      notation. Formulas are instructions to
      <application>Gnumeric</application> to calculate a result. The
      power of spreadsheets comes from these formulas because the
      results of the calculation can depend on the contents of other
      cells. Boolean values are either TRUE or FALSE and can be used
      in logical statements. Error values are usually the result of
      mistakes or impossible calculations.
    </para>

    <para>
      For more advanced information on the types of data usable in
      <application>Gnumeric</application>, see <xref
      linkend="sect-data-types"/>.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Putting Data into the Spreadsheet</title>

    <para>
      In order to enter data into the spreadsheet, the user must first
      select a cell in which to place the information and then
      actually type the information on the keyboard. Once the
      information is entered, <application>Gnumeric</application>
      attempts to figure out both the appropriate data value type to
      assign to the cell and the appropriate data format in which to
      display this data value. Because this process is quite complex,
      users may occasionally be forced to actively select these
      parameters of the cells, which is explained in <xref
      linkend="quick-format" /> below. The next two sections explain
      how to get data into a cell, first by moving the selection box
      to a desired cell and then by typing the data.
    </para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Moving the selection box</title>
      <para>
        In order to enter data into
        <application>Gnumeric</application> the selection box must be
        placed over the appropriate cell. The selection box appears on
        the cell grid as a double lined rectangle with a small grey
        square in the lower right corner of the box. By default the
        selection box surrounds the top, leftmost cell in the cell
        grid area.
      </para>

      <para>
        The simplest way to move the selection box is to use the
        mouse. If the mouse cursor is placed over the cell "C3" (the
        cursor will be represented as a thick white cross) and the
        left mouse button then clicked, the selection box will move to
        cell "C3". Note that the selection box can cover more than one
        cell if the mouse is dragged while being clicked. The use of
        these larger selections is explained below in <xref
        linkend="quick-complex-select" />.
      </para>

      <tip>
        <para>
          The selection box also causes the header of the column and
          row to change slightly. The headers will turn a darker shade
          of gray and the font of the letters and numbers turn
          bold. This helps indicate what is currently being selected.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <para>
        The selection box can also be moved with the keyboard arrow
        keys. For instance, typing the right arrow twice and the down
        arrow once will move the selection box from the cell "C3" to
        the cell "E4".
      </para>

      <para>
        The selection box can be moved in other ways and will move in
        response to certain actions. These movements become intuitive
        after using <application>Gnumeric</application> for a little
        while.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Data Input</title>

      <para>
        In order to enter data into a selected cell, one can simply
        start typing. The characters will then become part of the
        spreadsheet when the selection is changed either by typing the
        <keycap>Enter</keycap> key, which moves the selection down one
        cell, by typing the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key, which moves the
        selection one cell to the right, or by selecting any other
        cell with the mouse.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, the mouse could be used to select the cell four
        columns over (Column D) and three rows down (Row 3). Then the
        user could type "Hello, this is a line of text." and then type
        the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key. The text would then appear in
        cell "D3" and, if the cells to the right are empty, would span
        into those cells so that the whole entry is visible. The
        selection box moves when the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key is
        typed and will therefore appear afterwards in cell "D4", ready
        for the input of more data.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Note that as the data text is entered it appears in both the
          cell and in the data entry area (the area below the toolbars
          to the right of the equals (=) sign).
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        Mistakes which are made during data entry can be corrected by
        using the <keycap>Backspace</keycap> key or the
        <keycap>Delete</keycap> key. Finer control can be obtained if
        the cursor is moved to the text entry area by clicking in the
        box to the right of the equals (=) sign with the
        mouse. Editing in the text entry area enables the arrow keys
        to navigate backwards and forwards within the text being
        entered and also enables the mouse to be used to move the
        cursor.
      </para>

      <para>
        The contents of a cell can be changed simply by selecting the
        cell again and either typing the new contents or editing the
        existing contents of the cells.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          If the content of the cell is too large for the size of the
          cell, the entry may span over the edge of the cell into the
          empty cells to the right. If the cell is a number, the cell
          grid area may display hash marks (######) to indicate the
          cell has content which is too large to display in the given
          cell width.
        </para>
      </note>

    <sect3>
      <title>Data recognition</title>

      <para>
        As data are entered into the spreadsheet,
        <application>Gnumeric</application> interprets the information
        in order, first, to assign it to a data category and, second,
        to give it an appropriate data display format. The entry will
        be assigned to one of the basic data types and possibly to a
        sub-type. Entries which start with an apostrophe (') are
        considered to be text no matter what the rest of the
        contents. Entries which start with an equals sign (=) are
        automatically considered to be a formula. Entries which are
        single numbers or which fall into commonly used patterns for
        dates or times will be considered to be numbers.
      </para>

      <para>
        <application>Gnumeric</application> usually figures out
        correctly both the type and the appropriate display format for
        the data being entered. Occasionally, the user will have to
        force <application>Gnumeric</application> to consider the data
        to be a different data type than
        <application>Gnumeric</application> would guess by
        default. The details of this process is explained in greater
        detail in the extended chapter on data, <xref
        linkend="chapter-data" />.
      </para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Entering text</title>

      <para>
        Entering text simply requires selecting the appropriate cell,
        typing the text and then the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key. If the
        text is too large to fit in its own cell, and the cell to its
        right is empty, the text will span into the cell on the
        right. By default, <application>Gnumeric</application> uses a
        display format for text in which the contents are shown left
        justified.
      </para>

      <para>
        Entering numbers requires selecting the appropriate cell,
        typing in a number and then the <keycap>Enter</keycap>
        key. <application>Gnumeric</application> recognizes several
        types of information to be numbers.
      </para>

      <para>
        The simplest kind of input which
        <application>Gnumeric</application> recognizes as numbers are
        standard numeric values. Technically, these are contiguous
        sequences of digits which may have a separator symbol between
        the thousands and another symbol indicating the decimal
        separator. These symbols follow the English convention by
        default (comma as thousand separator, period as decimal
        symbol) but will adopt the symbols appropriate for a different
        locality if <application>Gnumeric</application> is launched in
        a particular way. For instance, in a French setting the period
        is the thousand separator symbol and the comma the decimal
        separator symbol. <!-- ToDo: add ref to localization --> By
        default, <application>Gnumeric</application> will display
        these numeric values lined up against the right side of the
        cell.
      </para>

      <para>
        Several other types of input are recognized as numeric values
        which means that calculations can be performed on the values
        in the cells.

      <title>Entering a Formula</title>

      <para>
        Entering a formula requires selecting a cell and typing in the
        equals sign (=) and then a valid formula. If
        <application>Gnumeric</application> cannot understand the
        formula which is entered, it will open a dialog box which may
        have an explanation and gives the user a chance either to
        re-edit the expression or to accept the entry as a text entry
        instead of a formula. The second choice makes it easy to
        re-edit the entry into a valid formula simply by fixing the
        formula and removing the leading apostrophe (') before the
        equals sign.
      </para>

      <para>
        Formulas can be quite complex since the power of spreadsheets
        comes from these formulas. A simple example of the use of a
        formula is as follows: first, select cell B2 and input the
        value "3" into that cell. Second, select cell D4 and input
        (without the quotes) "=B2+2" and then type the
        <keycap>Enter</keycap> key. Cell D4 should display the value
        "5". If the value of cell B2 is changed from "3" to "100",
        <application>Gnumeric</application> will automatically update
        the value of cell D4 to "102".
      </para>

      <para>
        A valid formula can be a simple arithmetic equation such as 
        <screen>
          =3+4-1
        </screen>
        which uses a formula to make the cell equal to the value
        6.
      </para>

      <para>
        Formulas may include calls to functions. These are statements
        which indicate that more complex operations should be
        performed. For instance, a formula could be "=EXP(24)" which
        would give the value of e (the base of the natural logarithm)
        raised to the 24th power. The cell would then display
        "2.6489e+10".
      </para>

      <para>
        As was shown in the example above, formulas may contain
        `references' to the contents of another cell. In the example
        given above, the contents of the cell in the second column and
        the second row was used in a calculation by using the cell
        name "B2". These references mean that complex calculations can
        be automatically updated when one of the original values
        change. 
      </para>

      <para>
        References can be made to the cells in other worksheets and
        even to those in other workbooks (files). The basic format of
        a complete reference is made of the name of the file the
        reference is in, enclosed by square brackets, followed by the
        name of the sheet, followed by an exclamation point, followed
        by the letters of the column, followed by the number of the
        row. For example, a complete reference could be
        "[my_file.gnumeric]"Sheet3"!C3". These complete references can
        be shortened if the filename or sheet names are the same as
        that of the reference. "AE34" would refer to the cell in the
        current file, in the current worksheet which is in column "AE"
        and in row "34".
      </para>

      <para>
        References can refer to a range of contiguous range of
        cells. For instance, the reference "A1: E5" refers to all the
        cells from the top-left most cell of the current sheet to the
        cell five rows down and five rows over. This can be useful in
        a formula which uses a function such as MAX(). The formula
        "=MAX(A1:E5)" would display the value of the largest number
        value in this range of cells.
      </para>

      <para>

        in <xref linkend="sect-data-formulas-references" /> later on in this

      <title>Entering an Error Value</title>

        directly but generally arise when formulas cannot calculate
        valid results.

<sect1 id="quick-format">
  <title>Cell Formats</title>

  <para>
    The data in <application>Gnumeric</application> are stored in the
    cells of the spreadsheet, each of which has a cell format which
    dictates how the data will be displayed, whether the cell will
    have borders and other information. Cell formatting can be quite
    confusing at first because it combines simple changes, such as the
    colour of the characters being displayed, with more complex ideas,
    such as how future changes to the cell will be interpreted.
  </para>

  <para>
    All of the cell formatting commands can be reached through a
    context menu by right clicking on a cell and selecting the
    <guilabel>Format Cells...</guilabel> menu entry. This will open a
    dialog window with tabs which group together similar types of
    formatting. Clicking on the <guilabel>Font</guilabel> tab allows a
    user to change the font famly, style, size and colour. For
    instance, if the cell B2 contained the text "Hello, this is my
    first spreadsheet" then this text could be made bigger by
    selecting a larger font size.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="quick-format-simple">
    <title>Simple Cell Formating</title>

    <para>
      Simple changes to the format of a cell include changing the

      changing the border, and changing the colour or pattern of the
      background.

      The <guilabel>Alignment</guilabel>, <guilabel>Font</guilabel>,
      <guilabel>Border</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Background</guilabel>

    <title>Formating the Display and Entry Data Types</title>

    <para>
      Cell formats are most difficult to understand when they address
      the type of data stored and the visual display of that
      data. This only arises with the options selected in the
      <guilabel>Number</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Format
      Cells</guilabel> dialog. While these ideas are complex, they
      must be understood at the beginning because they are fundamental
      to spreadsheet use.
    </para>

    <para>
      When data are entered into <application>Gnumeric</application>,
      the spreadsheet interprets the entry based on the input format
      of the cell. The default format of empty cells is the
      <guilabel>General</guilabel> format which instructs
      <application>Gnumeric</application> to guess both the type of
      the data being entered and a suitable display format for that
      data type. However, the <guilabel>General</guilabel> format can
      be changed to a specific format in order to alter both the way
      <application>Gnumeric</application> interprets any future data
      input to the cell and the way data in the cell are displayed.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Changing the format does not alter the data type of data
        already in a cell but does alter the display format of that
        data. This means that the input format will only affect future
        input whereas the display format will affect both the data
        currently in the cell and any data placed later into the cell.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      For example, if a user enters "12/25/2000" (without the quotes),
      <application>Gnumeric</application> guesses that this is a date
      and stores the value 36885. (The value
      <application>Gnumeric</application> uses for dates is the number
      of days since the last day of 1899. However,
      <application>Gnumeric</application> perpetuates an error of
      <application>Excel</application> for the sake of compatibility
      and assumes 1900 to be a leap year even though it was not.) At
      the same time, <application>Gnumeric</application> changes the
      display format to display this number as a date, with a numeric
      month, day and year, separated by slashes.
    </para>

    <important>
      <para>
        The order in which the formatting operations occur is
        critical. It is not possible to alter the type of a datum
        currently in a cell by formatting. To alter the intrepretation
        of the data type in a cell, formatting must occur
        <emphasis>prior</emphasis> to the entry of the data.
      </para>
    </important>

    <para>
      It sometimes becomes necessary to override the "General" type if
      <application>Gnumeric</application> is making an incorrect
      assessment of the data being entered. Postal Zip Codes in the
      United States, for instance, are incorrectly interpreted to be
      numbers. Some of these Zip Codes start with a leading zero which
      the "General" format type drops so the user must
      intervene to keep that zero displayed. In order to input these
      Zip Codes, the following steps must be performed. First, the
      cell must be selected. Next, the cell must be formatted to hold
      a "Text" value. This formatting changes both the interpretation
      of any future data entry into this cell and alters the display
      formatting of the cell. Finally, the Zip Code can be
      entered. Following these steps, the data value will be
      considered to be a "Text" value, any leading zeros will be
      retained and the data will be left justifed since this is the
      default display format for "Text" values.
    </para>

    <tip>
      <para>
        If the data type of a whole column needs to be altered prior
        to data entry, this can be done in one formatting
        operation. First the whole column must be selected by clicking
        on the column header (the letters at the top). Next, the
        selected cells can be formatted at once by clicking the right
        mouse button to obtain the context menu or by selecting the
        <guimenu>Format</guimenu> menu and the
        <guimenuitem>Cells...</guimenuitem> menu entry. This quick
        approach to pre-formatting cells can also be done for any
        group of selected cells.

    <title>Complex Cell Selections</title>
  
    <para>
      Selections can be more complex than a single cell at a
      time. Selections may describe a continuous rectangular block of
      cells, an arbitrary shaped group of cells or even a discontinous
      group of cells.
    </para>

    <para>
      The most common way to select a continous rectangular block of
      cells uses a click and drag mouse motion. The cells in this
      continous block can be selected by clicking and holding the left
      mouse button down on one of the corner cells (for instance, the
      top, leftmost cell) and dragging the mouse cursor to the
      opposite corner (for instance, the bottom, rightmost cell)
      before releasing. The selection box will expand to include all
      of the cells in this range.
    </para>

    <para>
      The most common way to select an arbitrary shaped or
      discontinous group of cells is to hold down the
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key while using the mouse to select
      cells. As long as the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key is held down,
      all of the cells included by a click or a click and drag motion
      will be added to the selection.

  <title>Moving Cell Contents, Inserting New Cells or Deleting Cells</title>

  <para>
    The contents of cells, both data values and formatting, can be
    moved from one part of a spreadsheet to another so that data do
    not have to be re-entered if the spreadsheet is reorganized. New
    cells can be added to a spreadsheet and old cells removed but
    these latter operations cause the layout of the spreadsheet to be
    altered.
  </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Moving Cell Contents</title>

    <para>
      The simplest way to move cell contents around a spreadsheet
      involves selecting a block of cells containing the contents to
      be moved, either "cutting" or "copying" those cells, selecting
      the location where these contents are to be moved and then
      pasting the data.
    </para>

    <para>
      Moving data can only be performed with a single selection of
      cells which means that only continous rectangular blocks of
      cells can be moved. This does mean, however, that columns or
      rows can be moved as a unit. By default,
      <application>Gnumeric</application> moves the entire contents of
      the cells including both the data values and the formatting of
      the cells.
    </para>

    <para>
      Once a group of cells is selected, they can be "cut" or "copied"
      either using the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu, the toolbar
      buttons (a pair of scissors or two pieces of paper, respectively),
      the right mouse button context menu or keyboard shortcuts
      (<keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>X</keysym></keycombo> or
      <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>C</keysym></keycombo>
      respectively). If cells are "cut" the contents will be removed
      from the current location. If cells are "copied", the contents
      will be duplicated in the new location. These two operations
      treat cell references in formulas slightly differently. If cells
      are "cut", any references in the cells in the new location will
      remain pointed at the original cells. If cells are "copied", the
      references in the cells in the new location will point to cells
      in the same relative position.
    </para>

    <para>
      The new location for the cells can be selected in two ways. The
      simplest is to select the top, left cell of the new
      location. Alternatively, the whole new range of cells can be
      selected but the shape of this new range must match exactly the
      dimensions of the original range which is more difficult.
    </para>

    <para>
      Finally the cell contents can be "pasted" in the new location
      using either the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu
      <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> menu entry, the toolbar button
      with a clipboard, the context menu
      <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> menu entry or the
      <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>V</keysym></keycombo>
      keyboard shortcut.
    </para>

    <para>
      An alternative way to move cells in a current worksheet involves
      dragging and dropping the original selection. The cells to be
      moved are selected as above. The mouse cursor is then placed on
      the thick white selection border. If the left hand button is
      clicked and held, the selected cells can be dragged to a new
      location resulting in the same operation as a "cut" and a
      "paste". If the <keysym>Ctrl</keysym> key is held down during
      the click and drag of the mouse, the result is the same as a
      "copy" and "paste" operation and can be repeated several times.
    </para>

    <para>
      Both the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu and the context menu have
      an extra menu entry called <guimenuitem>Paste
      Special...</guimenuitem> which can be used during a cut and
      paste operation to seletively transfer some of the original the
      cell contents or to alter the contents in specific ways. This
      option allows the transfer of only the cell contents, only the
      cell formats or only the calculated values of the cells. The
      transfered contents can also be mathematically combined with the
      current contents of cells in the new location. Alternatively,
      the selection can be transposed. See <xref
      linkend="sect-movecopy-pastespecial" /> for more information on
      the <guimenuitem>Paste Special...</guimenuitem> command.

    <title>Inserting and Deleting Cells</title>

    <para>
      A worksheet can also be altered by inserting or by deleting
      cells. These operations actually alter the locations of cells in
      a workbook.
    </para>

    <para>
      Inserting and deleting columns and rows are easy to
      understand. If a group of columns or rows is selected, selecting
      the <guimenuitem>Column</guimenuitem> or
      <guimenuitem>Row</guimenuitem> menu entries in the
      <guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu will add the same number of
      columns to the left of the selected columns or of rows above the
      selected rows. The context menu can also be used for the insert
      operation. The context menu can be used to delete the currently
      selected columns or rows.
    </para>

    <warning>
      <para>
        Insert operations can result in the loss of data if the last
        columns or rows currently contain information.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <para>
      Individual cells or contiguious rectangular blocks of cells can
      also be inserted and deleted. During this operation, the user is
      asked which way to shift the current cells to allow the
      insertion or deletion of the selected cells. The movement can be
      along the rows or along the columns and will result in the
      relative movement of cells which were previously
      contiguous. This shift is the fundamental difference between
      insert and delete operations compared to cut or copy and paste
      operations.

    Sometimes you want your book to be saved often so you do not lose
    any work. To save the book at intervals click on
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Auto Save
    &hellip;</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  The <interface> Auto
    Save</interface> dialog appears.

    Click on the <guibutton>Automatic Save Every</guibutton> button
    and enter the number of minutes will pass between each save.  When
    the interval is shorter more of your work will be potentially
    saved, but <application>Gnumeric</application> might appear
    sluggish.  If <application>Gnumeric</application> is sluggish
    increase the time between saves.  The button <guibutton>Prompt
    Before Saving</guibutton> brings up a dialog to ask if you want to
    save the book.

  <warning>
    <para>
      Using the automatic saving feature of
      <application>Gnumeric</application> can save time but is
      dangerous. <application>Gnumeric</application> does not create a
      new file each time a file is saved but instead
      <application>Gnumeric</application> modifies the existing file
      which destroys the previous work. In certain situations, this
      feature can lead to the loss of possibly important work. Users
      are highly recommended to backup their work by copying the
      original file to a new name or by saving files to newly named
      files.

    An existing spreadsheet file can be opened in several ways. If the
    file has an icon on the desktop, this icon can be clicked or
    double-clicked with the mouse button. Similarly, if a file
    manager, such as the <application>Nautilus</application> file
    manager, lists the file, then the file name can be clicked and
    opened. If <application>Gnumeric</application> is already opened,
    a file can be opened by clicking on the <guimenu>File</guimenu>
    and selecting the <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem> menu
    item. Alternatively, the "Open file" button on the toolbar,

	  <textobject>
		<phrase>An image of the "Open File" button.</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</inlinemediaobject>, 
    can be used or the <keysym>F3</keysym> key clicked.  All three of
    these open the <interface>Open File</interface> dialog.  You can
    then select the spreadsheet file you wish to open.
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can open many different types
    of spreadsheet file formats.

    <para>
      If the file has recently been opened in
      <application>Gnumeric</application>, the file name will appear
      in the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and can simply be clicked to
      re-open the file.

  <title>Closing Gnumeric</title>

  <para>
    There are several ways to close
    <application>Gnumeric</application>. The simplest is to select the
    <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and then the
    <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> menu option at the bottom of the
    <guimenu>File</guimenu>.
  </para>

  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can also be closed through the
    window manager by clicking on a close box in the window frame or
    through a pop-up menu. The placement of the box and the invocation
    of the menu depend on the particular window manager and the theme
    being used. If the GNOME panel is running the window list applet,
    clicking with the right mouse button opens a context menu with a
    <guimenuitem>Close</guimenuitem> which can be used to close
    <application>Gnumeric</application>.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      If any changes have been made to the workbook since the last
      time it was saved, a dialog will open to ask what is supposed to
      happen to the contents of the workbook. At this point the
      contents of the workbook can be saved (Save), the request to
      close gnumeric can be canceled (Don't Quit) or the most recent
      changes can be discarded (Discard). If the user decides to save
      the content, a second dialog may open requesting a file name,
      location and type for the saved workbook.
    </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      Any files which are saved by <application>Gnumeric</application>
      must be deleted by the user. Either the GNOME file manager
      <application>Nautilus</application> or the shell tool
      <command>rm</command> can be used to delete the files.
