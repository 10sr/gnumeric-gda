  <title>An Overview of Worksheets and Views</title>

  <para>
    Each workbook (or file) can contain multiple worksheets which hold
    both the cell grid and graphical objects such as charts and
    drawing elements. The collection of worksheets can be manipulated
    allowing the addition, duplication, deletion and re-ordering of
    worksheets within a workbook. <application>Gnumeric</application>
    includes several techniques to work simultaneously with several
    different views of the same workbook, to fix parts of a worksheet
    and scroll others or to group data within a worksheet for
    convenient editing and analysis.
