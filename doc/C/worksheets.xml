  <para>
    Worksheets provide the principal work area for &gnum; users. The
    worksheet allows users to enter data, develop analyses of these
    data, and display both data and results. Worksheets also contain
    graphical elements such as graphs and widgets. The worksheets are
    themselves grouped into a workbook which will be stored in a
    &gnum; file. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The content of each worksheet includes the cell contents and
    metadata. The contents of the cell include any data contents, cell
    comments or sheet objects, such as graphical plots. The metadata
    include the worksheet name and worksheet settings controlling the
    visual appearance of the worksheet or the display of the
    worksheet. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The display of each worksheet can be controlled by several
    settings and configurations. The worksheet, conceptually, consists
    of a single continuous two dimensional grid of cells arranged in
    65536 rows by 258 columns, and &gnum;, by default, displays a
    small portion of the worksheet area as a continuous region. This
    chapter presents several alternative settings which alter the
    display of cell contents or which allow the user to rearrange the
    cell grid to fix parts of the worksheet grid while scrolling
    others or to group rows or columns of data within a worksheet
    for convenient editing and analysis.

    <para>
      The worksheet grid in &gnum; consists, by default, of 65536 rows
      by 258 columns of cells. This default setting can be changed but
      this requires editing the actual computer program code and
      recompiling the code to make a new version of the &gnum;
      program. 
<!-- TODO: ask- how to change the size (row/col) of the cell grid? -->
<!-- TODO: add- add a link to compile section. -->
    </para>
  </note>


  <para>
    The collection of worksheets can be manipulated allowing the
    addition, duplication, deletion and re-ordering of worksheets
    within a workbook.
