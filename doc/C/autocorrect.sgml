  <title>AutoCorrect Tool</title>

  <para>The AutoCorrect tool can fix various kinds of spelling errors
  as you type text into the cells.  To use this tool, go to the
  ``Tools'' menu and select the ``Auto Correct'' menu option.  It
  gives you a dialog to choose autocorrection rules to be
  activated.</para>

  <para>If this tool is activated and it detects an error in the text
  you typed, it replaces the text with correct one.  The replacements
  are done accoring to the following rules.  Each rule can be
  activated or disactivated separately in the dialog.</para>

  <sect2 id="correct-initial-capitals">
     <title>Correct TWo INitial CApitals</title>

     <para>A common mistake is to hold down the shift key a little bit
     too long while typing initial letters.  When it happens, you will
     get two initial capitals instead of one.  If this correction rule
     is activated, the second letter of words beginning with two
     capital letters is automatically lowercased.  For example, if you
     type `TOtal' into a cell it is replaced by `Total'.  Note that if
     the word contains two capital letters only, it is not
     replaced.</para>

     <para>It is possible to specify exceptions to this tool.  For
     example, you do not want the tool to replace the word `PVbonds'
     when it is typed.  To specify exceptions, press the
     ``Exceptions...''  button in the dialog.  This should pop up the
     ``Auto correct exceptions'' dialog.  In this dialog, select the
     ``INitial CApitals'' page.  In this page, type `PVbonds' into the
     ``Do not correct'' entry, and press ``Add'' button.  Now the word
     should be included in the list of exceptions.  To remove a word
     from the list, select the word and press the ``Remove'' button.
     If you now press ``Ok'' the exceptions in the list are
     activated.</para>

  <sect2 id="correct-first-letter">
     <title>Capitalize first letter of sentence</title>

     <para>If this correction rule is activated, the first letter of a
     sentence typed into a cell is capitalized, if it is a lowercase
     letter in the first place.  Only text that ends to a dot is
     considered a sentence.</para>

     <para>It is possible to specify exceptions to this tool.  For
     example, you do not want the tool to capitalize letters after
     accronym `i.g.'.  To specify exceptions, press the
     ``Exceptions...''  button in the dialog.  This should pop up the
     ``Auto correct exceptions'' dialog.  In this dialog, select the
     ``First letter'' page.  In this page, type `i.g.' into the ``Do
     not capitalize after'' entry, and press ``Add'' button.  Now the
     word should be included in the list of exceptions.  To remove a
     word from the list, select the word and press the ``Remove''
     button.  If you now press ``Ok'' the exceptions in the list are
     activated.</para>

  <sect2 id="correct-capitalize-days">
     <title>Capitalize names of days</title>

     <para>If this correction rule is activated, the first letter of a
     name of a day is capitalized automatically.  For example, if you
     type `monday', it is automatically replaced by `Monday'.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="correct-first-letter">
     <title>Correct accidental use of cAPS LOCK key</title>

     <para>Another common typing mistake to have the caps lock on when
     it should have been off.  This leads easily to texts where all
     the letters except the first letter are in uppercase.  If this
     correction rule is activated, the texts having this mistake are
     repleced by the same text but case reverted.</para>
