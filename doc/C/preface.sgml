  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> is a spreadsheet created by the
    <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</ulink> project.
    This manual describes version 1.0.

	<para>
	  <guilabel>Stability</guilabel> &mdash;
	  <application>Gnumeric</application> has undergone significant amounts
	  of testing with a diverse group of users.  There is also a large set of
	  test workbooks to validate the quality of the importers.  This
	  release can be considered safe for use in a production environment.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <guilabel>File compatibility</guilabel> &mdash;
	  Transparent access and manipulation of files from other applications
	  is vital in a modern office.  <application>Gnumeric</application> can
	  read files from several well known proprietary and free spreadsheets
	  including MS Excel (tm), Lotus 1-2-3 (tm), Applix (tm), Sylk, XBase
	  and Oleo.  It can also export to MS Excel (tm) along with several
	  open formats such as LaTeX \longtables, HTML, roff, and boasts highly
	  configurable text exporter .  New formats can easily be
	  added in a modular fashion via a plug-in.

	<para>
	  <guilabel>Minimal the cost of transition</guilabel> &mdash;
	  Learning new and unfamiliar interfaces is an expensive and frustrating
	  process.  <application>Gnumeric</application> attempts to offer
	  optional extensions and enough compatibility that a user's
	  familiarity with other applications will still apply.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <guilabel>Sufficient feature set</guilabel> &mdash;
	  While people may quote the statistic that most users only need 20% of
	  the features in some products that is not entirely true.  Most need a
	  common 10% and then some non-overlapping collection for the other 10%.
	  Implementing enough of the features to support day to day use by the
	  average spreadsheet user has taken time.  However, just having the
	  feature listed as a bullet point does little for a user.
	  <application>Gnumeric</application> has attempted to only provide
	  full implementations of the features it offers, preferring to leave a
	  feature out, rather than provide something that is only useful in a
	  screen-shot.

	released under the
	<ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
	GPL</ulink>.  It's core architecture has also seen alot of design work
	to ensure that it can comfortably scale to moderately large loads (1M
	cells) while remaining usable on older hardware.  The availability of
	clean reasonably documented source makes it simple to do things like
	change the maximum size of a sheet.

    <title>Getting started using Gnumeric.</title>
    <para>
      The best way to learn how to use Gnumeric is to begin exploring the
      program yourself. Enter some data into cells by clicking on the cell,
      typing a number and hitting return. Gnumeric supports different kinds of
      data such as numbers, dates, currency and text by formating each kind of
      data differently and by calculating results appropriate to each data
      type. To learn more look at the manual section on data entry
      <xref linkend="editing">.
    </para>

    <para>
      Write a formula by clicking on an empty cell, typing the equals key,
      clicking on a second cell that has a number, typing the minus key, typing
      2 and hitting return. The number you see should be the number in the
      second cell minus two. Try changing the number in the second cell and
      watch <application>Gnumeric</application> automatically re-calculate the
      result. For more powerful functions see the section on formulas <xref
      linkend="formulas"> later in this manual.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can format the data, by changing the text colour, adding borders and
      changing the placement. Explore the bottom toolbar and the menu that
      opens when you click on a cell with the rightmost mouse button. Look at 
      <xref linkend="formatting"> later in this manual. </para>
