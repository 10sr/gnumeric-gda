	<title>Overview.</title>

	<para>This part of the Gnumeric manual explains the pieces of the software
	that users can manipulate. The menus, the toolbars and the cell grid area
	comprise what is called the graphical user interface of an application because it is 
	an interface  &mdash;a way to interact with Gnumeric&mdash; which is made of 
	graphical elements  &mdash;pictures &mdash; designed to be used by human users.</para>

	<para>Gnumeric opens by default with a view of an empty workbook which is called "Book
	1" and with a single worksheet called "Sheet 1" as can be seen in 
	<xref linkend="gnumeric-labelled.png">. The outermost portion of the window is not 
	actually part of gnumeric and may look different on different machines. Gnumeric 
	attempts to place its name and the name of the workbook on this outer portion.</para>

	<para>The majority of spreadsheet work is done while interacting with this view of 
	Gnumeric. All of the functions which Gnumeric provides can be accessed quickly 
	from here. The graphic elements of Gnumeric are made of several independent pieces. 
	<xRef linkend="gnumeric-labelled.png"> shows a newly opened, empty Gnumeric with the
	principle elements labelled.</para>

	  			</guiicon>
			</term>
			<listitem>
	  		<para>The menubar provides access to the core of gnome. Almost
everything that can be done in gnumeric can be done through the menus. The
menus and menubar are discussed in <xRef linkend="menus">. </para>

	  			</guiicon>
			</term>
			<listitem>
	  		<para>The standard toolbar provides shortcuts for the most used items 
		in the menus. The toolbars are discussed in <xRef linkend="toolbars"> and 
		this toolbar in particular in <xRef linkend="std-toolbar">. </para>

	    		The data entry area.
	  			</guiicon>
			</term>
			<listitem>
	  		<para>The data entry area is useful for the modification of complex

    	  <varlistentry>

	    		The Information area.
	  			</guiicon>
			</term>
			<listitem>
	  		<para>This area is used by gnumeric to give feedback on the status of 
			certain operations. This information is explained in 
			<xRef linkend="info-area">. </para>

    	  </varlistentry>


    	  <varlistentry>

	  			<guiicon>
				<inlinegraphic fileref="figures/label-six.png"></inlinegraphic>
	    		The object toolbar.
	  			</guiicon>
			</term>
			<listitem>
	  		<para>This toolbar enables the user to draw graphic elements on the sheet, 
			such as "circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, 
			explaining what each one was, to be used as evidence against us." The use 
			of the toolbars and the objects it creates is discussed in 
			<xRef linkend="obj-toolbar">. This is a sub-section of the discussion in 
			<xRef linkend="toolbars"> on Gnumeric toolbars. </para>
			</listitem>

			<term>

				<inlinegraphic fileref="figures/label-seven.png"></inlinegraphic>
				The Cell Area.
				</guiicon>
				</term>
			<listitem>
			<para>The cell area lies in the middle of all the rest. The cell
			area includes the row and column labels, the scrollbars and the tabs 
			below. The use of these elements is explained in 
			<xRef linkend="cell-grid">.</para>
			</listitem>
		  </varlistentry>

	</variablelist>

	<para>The rest of this chapter will explain most of these elements. A few of these 
	functions are complicated (and powerful) so they are explained in larger sections 
	later in the manual. The next section gives references to those detailled 
	so that readers looking for advanced information can skip to those sections
	directly.</para>
