  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can create graphs with data in a
    worksheet.  To do this, you need a modern version of
    <application>Guppi</application> (>= 0.40.0 ) installed that has
    <application>Gnumeric</application> support built in.
  </para>
  <para>
    With <application>Guppi</application> support, you should see a
    new icon that looks like a graph, next to the <guibutton>Sort
    Down</guibutton> button in the toolbar.  That is the
    <guibutton>Graph</guibutton> button.
  </para>
  <para>
    <application>Gnumeric</application> can make the following graph
    types:

      stop with a simple graph.  In the graphs you make, you can
      customize it.  For example, you can say which cells define the
      ranges or labels.  If a label for a field is in paraenthesis, it
      means that field is optional.
