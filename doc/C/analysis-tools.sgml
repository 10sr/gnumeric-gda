  <title>Data Analysis Tools</title>

  <para>The data analysis tools package contains various tools for
  statistical data analysis, random number generation and data
  sampling.  To use these tools select the ``Data Analysis...'' entry
  in the ``Tools'' menu.  This gives you a list of tools to choose
  from.  Select one of the tools from the list and press the OK
  button.  The tools are described below.</para>

  <para>All the tools have the same output options.  The results can
  be printed out into a new sheet, into a new workbook, or into the
  same sheet within a given output range.  To select the output method
  just select one of the radio buttons bellow the ``Output options:''
  label.  Note that if the output is pasted into a range that is too
  small, some of the results will not fit in it.  Also not that the
  old data in the output range is lost.</para>

     <title>Anova: Single Factor Tool</title>

     <para>Use this tool to make a single factor analysis of the
     variances of given variables. The variables are specified by the
     ``Input Range:'' entry.  The given range can be groupped either
     by columns or by rows.  ``Alpha:'' entry specifies the level of
     significance which is by default 95%.</para>

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button on.  This leaves the first row (or the first
     column if the data is groupped by rows) of the input range out of
     the analysis.  In addition, the names of the variables are
     pasted nicely into the output table.</para>

     <para>The tool calculates the source of variation between groups,
     within groups, and the total source of variation.  The values of
     these are given in the ''SS'' column.  The degrees of freedom of
     are given in the ''df'' column.  In ''MS'' column the sources of
     variation are divided by the degrees of freedom.  The results of
     these divisions are used in calculating the F value in the ''F''
     column.  The F value is the division of MS in ''Between columns''
     and ''MS'' in ''Within columns''.  You can compare this value
     with the ''F critical'' value in the last column.  The F critical
     value is the largest value of F that is statistically significant
     using the given significance level (''Alpha'').  Bellow the
     ''P-value'' is the result of the F-test.</para>

     <para>In addition, the tool calculates the count, sum, average,
     and the variance of all the variables.</para>

     <title>Correlation Tool</title>

     <para>The correlation tool calculates correlation coefficients of
     given variables.  Use this tool to calculate any number of
     correlation coefficients at the same time.  The variables for
     which the correlations are calulated are specified by the ``Input
     Range:'' entry.  The given range can be groupped either by
     columns or by rows.</para>

     <para>For example, you want to calculate the correlation between
     two variables, one in a column A and the other in a column B.
     Both variables have 10 values in rows between one and ten.  First
     you should enter A1:B10 to the ``Input Range:'' entry.  Secondly,
     select the ``Columns'' radio button next to the ``Groupped By:''
     label.  Then specify the output options described above and press
     the OK button.</para>

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button on.  This leaves the first row (or the first
     column if the data is groupped by rows) of the input range out of
     the analysis.  In addition, the names of the variables are
     printed nicely into the output table.</para>

     <para>The results are printed into a table where each column and
     row is labeled according to the names of the variables.  If the
     names are not given in the input range, Gnumeric generates them
     for you.  The calculated correlations are given in the table.
     For example, the correlation of the previous example, i.e,
     correlation between a variable in a column A and B, can be read
     in the second column and third row of the results table (bellow
     the column labeled ``Column 1'' and in the row labeled ``Column
     2'').</para>
  </sect2>


  <sect2>
     <title>Covariance Tool</title>

     <para>The covariance tool calculates covariance of given
     variables.  Use this tool to calculate any number of covariances
     at the same time.  The variables for which the covariances are
     calulated are specified by the ``Input Range:'' entry.  The given
     range can be groupped either by columns or by rows.</para>

     <para>For example, you want to calculate the covarance of two
     variables, one in a column A and the other in a column B.  Both
     variables have 10 values in rows between one and ten.  First you
     should enter A1:B10 to the ``Input Range:'' entry.  Secondly,
     select the ``Columns'' radio button next to the ``Groupped By:''
     label.  Then specify the output options described above and press
     the OK button.</para>

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button on.  This leaves the first row (or the first
     column if the data is groupped by rows) of the input range out of
     the analysis.  In addition, the names of the variables are
     printed nicely into the output table.</para>

     <para>The results are printed into a table where each column and
     row is labeled according to the names of the variables.  If the
     names are not given in the input range, Gnumeric generates them
     for you.  The calculated covariances are given in the table.  For
     example, the covariance of the previous example, i.e, covariance
     between a variable in a column A and B, can be read in the second
     column and third row of the results table (bellow the column
     labeled ``Column 1'' and in the row labeled ``Column 2'').</para>

     <title>Descriptive Statistics Tool</title>

     <para>The descriptive statistics tool calculates some statistical
     information of the given variables.  Use this tool to calculate
     general statistical measures and confidence levels for mean for
     any number variables at the same time.  The variables for which
     the statistical analysis is made are specified by the ``Input
     Range:'' entry.  The given range can be groupped either by
     columns or by rows.</para>

     <para>This tool can produce four different kinds of statistical
     data.  The summary statistics is produced if the button
     ``Summary Statistics'' is checked on.  This tool calculates the
     mean, standard error, median, mode, standard deviation, sample
     variance, kurtosis, skewness, range, minimum, maximum, sum, and
     count for each given variable.</para>

     <para>If ``Confidence Level for Mean'' button is checked on, the
     tool calculates the confidence level for mean for each variable.
     You should specify the percentage of the confidence in the entry
     box.  The default value is to calculate the confidence level of
     95%.</para>

     <para>If ``Kth Largest:'' button is checked on, the tool finds
     the kth largest value of each of the variables.  Specify the k in
     the entry box next to the check button.</para>

     <para>If ``Kth Smallest:'' button is checked on, the tool finds
     the kth smallest value of each of the variables.  Specify the k in
     the entry box next to the check button.</para>

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels in First Row'' button on.  This leaves the first row of
     the input range out of the analysis.  In addition, the names of
     the variables are printed nicely into the output table.</para>

  <sect2>
     <title>F-Test:Two-Sample for Variances Tool</title>

     <para>Use the F-Test tool to analyze wheater the variances of two
     variables are significantly different or not.  The values of the
     first variable are specified in the ``Variable 1 Range:'' entry.
     Correspondingly, the values of the second variable are given in
     the ``Variable 2 Range:'' entry.  ``Alpha:'' entry specifies the
     level of significance which is by default 95%.</para>

     <para>If the output is printed into a range, it should contain at
     least three columns and eight rows.</para>

     <para>The results are given in a table.  The tool calculates and
     prints the mean, variance, count of observations and the degree
     of freedom for both variables.  It also calculates the F-value,
     the one-tailed probability for the F-value, and the F Critical
     value for one-tailed test.  The one-tailed probability for the
     F-value (``P(F<=f) one-tail'' row) describes the risk of making a
     Type I error of one-tailed test.</para>
  </sect2>


  <sect2>
     <title>Random Number Generation Tool</title>

     <para>Use the random number generation tool to generate random
     numbers.  This tool can generate random numbers having different
     probability distributions.</para>

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the number of variables in
     the ``Number of Variables:'' entry box.  This determines the
     number of columns of random values to be produced.  Secondly,
     specify the number of random numbers.  This determines the number
     of rows of random values to be produced.  Thirdly specify the
     random distribution by selecting one of the list items from the
     random distribution list.  The following random distributions are
     supported: Discrete, Normal, Bernoulli, and Uniform.  Then
     specify the parameters of the distribution.</para>

     <sect3>
        <title>Random Distributions</title>

        <para>For Discrete random distribution, specify the value and
	probability input range in the ``Value and Probability Input
	Range:'' entry box.  That is a table consisting of two columns
	and any number of rows.  The first column specifies the
	discrete random values and the second column the probabilities
	for them.  The discrete random values do not have to be
	numbers, for example, strings will do as well.  The sum of the
	probabilities in the second column should be one.  For
	example, if you have the values A, B, C, and D in A1:A4 and
	values 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.3 in B1:B4, you could specify
	value and probability input range to be A1:B4.</para>

        <para>For Normal random distribution, specify the mean and the
	standard deviation.  The default values for them are 0 for
	mean and 1 for standard deviation.</para>

        <para>For Bernoulli random distribution, specify the ``p
        Value''.  This is a probability value between 0 and 1.
        Bernoulli distribution has two random values 0 and 1, and the
        ``p Value'' specifies the probability of value 1.  The mean of
        a random variable that has a Bernoulli distribution is E(X) =
        1(p) + 0(1-p) = p, and the variance is var(X) = p(1-p).</para>

        <para>For Uniform random distribution, specify the range of
        the random variables by filling the ``Between:'' and ``And:''
        entries.  The default values for them are 0 and 1 that gives
        random numbers between zero and one.</para>
     </sect3>
  </sect2>


  <sect2>
     <title>Sampling Tool</title>

     <para>Use the sampling tool to take a sample of a data set.  This
     tool can take both a random sample of a given size or a periodic
     sample where, for example, every fourth value of the data set is
     taken to the sample.</para>

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the data set by setting the
     ``Input Range:'' entry.  Then select the sampling method which
     can be either periodic or random.  Periodic sampling requires
     that you specify the period by typing a number to the ``Period:''
     entry.  For example, if you specify the period to be three then
     you will get a sample that has every third value of the original
     data set.  Random sampling requires that you specify the size of
     the random sample in ``Number of Samples:'' entry.  The size
     cannot be larger than the original data set since each value of
     the original data set is taken at most once to the sample.</para>
  </sect2>


  <sect2>
     <title>z-Test:Two Samples for Means Tool</title>

     <para>Use the z-Test tool to analyze wheater the means of two
     variables are significantly different or not.  The values of the
     first variable are specified in the ``Variable 1 Range:'' entry.
     Correspondingly, the values of the second variable are given in
     the ``Variable 2 Range:'' entry.  You should also specify the
     variances of both variables in the ``Variable 1 Variance
     (known):'' and ``Variable 2 Variance (known):'' entries.</para>

     <para>If you want to test wheater the difference of the means is
     larger than a given value, specify also the ``Hypothesized Mean
     Difference:'' entry.  ``Alpha:'' entry specifies the level of
     significance which is by default 95%.</para>

     <para>If the output is printed into a range, it should have at
     least three columns and ten rows.</para>

     <para>The results are given in a table.  The tool calculates and
     prints the mean, known variance, and count of observations of
     both variables.  It also calculates the z-value, the one-tailed
     and two-tailed probability for the z-value, and the z Critical
     value for one-tailed and two-tailed tests.  The one-tailed
     probability for the z-value (``P(Z<=z) one-tail'' row) describes
     the risk of making a Type I error of one-tailed test.</para>
