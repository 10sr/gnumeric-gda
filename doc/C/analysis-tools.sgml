  <sect2 id="anova-single-factor-tool">
     <title>Anova: Single Factor Tool</title>

     <para>Use this tool to make a single factor analysis of the
     variances of given variables. The variables are specified by the
     ``Input Range:'' entry.  The given range can be groupped either
     by columns or by rows.  ``Alpha:'' entry specifies the level of
     significance which is by default 95&percnt;.</para>

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button on.  This leaves the first row (or the first
     column if the data is groupped by rows) of the input range out of
     the analysis.  In addition, the names of the variables are
     pasted nicely into the output table.</para>

     <para>The tool calculates the source of variation between groups,
     within groups, and the total source of variation.  The values of
     these are given in the ''SS'' column.  The degrees of freedom of
     are given in the ''df'' column.  In ''MS'' column the sources of
     variation are divided by the degrees of freedom.  The results of
     these divisions are used in calculating the F value in the ''F''
     column.  The F value is the division of MS in ''Between columns''
     and ''MS'' in ''Within columns''.  You can compare this value
     with the ''F critical'' value in the last column.  The F critical
     value is the largest value of F that is statistically significant
     using the given significance level (''Alpha'').  Bellow the
     ''P-value'' is the result of the F-test.</para>

     <para>In addition, the tool calculates the count, sum, average,
     and the variance of all the variables.</para>

     <para>First
     you should enter A1:B11 in the ``Input Range:'' entry by typing

     Select the ``Columns'' radio button next to the ``Grouped By:''

     <para>The covariance tool calculates pairwise covariances of given

     at the same time.  The variables for which the covariances are
     calulated are specified by the ``Input Range:'' entry.  The given
     range can be grouped either by columns or by rows.</para>

     <para>For example, you want to calculate the covariance of two

     variables have 10 values in rows between one and ten.  First you
     should enter A1:B10 to the ``Input Range:'' entry.  Secondly,

     <para>The descriptive statistics tool calculates some statistical
     information of the given variables.  Use this tool to calculate
     general statistical measures and confidence levels for mean for
     any number variables at the same time.  The variables for which
     the statistical analysis is made are specified by the ``Input
     Range:'' entry.  The given range can be grouped either by
     columns or by rows.</para>

     <para>This tool can produce four different kinds of statistical
     data.  The summary statistics is produced if the button
     ``Summary Statistics'' is checked.  This tool calculates the
     mean, standard error, median, mode, standard deviation, sample
     variance, kurtosis, skewness, range, minimum, maximum, sum, and
     count for each given variable.</para>

     <para>If ``Confidence Interval for the Mean'' button is checked, the
     tool calculates  confidence intervals for the mean of each variable.
     You should specify the confidence level in the entry
     box.  The default value is to calculate the confidence level of
     95&percnt;.</para> 

     <note><para>The interval given will usually be wider than the 
     interval obtained using the CONFIDENCE function since that function
     assumes that the population standard deviation is known while this tool
     estimates the population standard deviation by the sample standard
     deviation.</para></note>

     <para>If ``Kth Largest:'' button is checked, the tool finds
     the kth largest value of each of the variables.  Specify the k in
     the entry box next to the check button.</para>

     <para>If ``Kth Smallest:'' button is checked, the tool finds
     the kth smallest value of each of the variables.  Specify the k in

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row (or column) of the given range, you should check the

     value for one-tailed test.  The one-tailed probability for the

     <title>Moving Average Tool</title>

     <para>Use the moving average tool to calculate moving averages of

     of the data that is lost in a simple average.  In addition,
     moving averages can be used to eliminate random variance.  For
     example, use this tool to create a smoother curve of a stock

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the cells containing the
     values whose moving averages you want to calculate in the ``Input
     Range'' entry.  Then specify the ``Interval'' for the moving
     average.  The interval specifies the number of values to be
     included in the moving average.</para>

     <para>The results are given in a column.  Each row represents the
     moving average for the corresponding row in the input range.  The

     <title>Random Number Generation Tool</title>

     <para>Use the random number generation tool to generate random
     numbers.  This tool can generate random numbers having different
     probability distributions.</para>

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the number of variables in
     the ``Number of Variables:'' entry box.  This determines the
     number of columns of random values to be produced.  Secondly,
     specify the number of random numbers.  This determines the number
     of rows of random values to be produced.  Thirdly specify the
     random distribution by selecting one of the list items from the
     random distribution list.  The following random distributions are
     supported: Discrete, Normal, Bernoulli, and Uniform.  Then
     specify the parameters of the distribution.</para>

     <sect2 id="random-distributions">
        <title>Random Distributions</title>

        <para>For Discrete random distribution, specify the value and
	probability input range in the ``Value and Probability Input
	Range:'' entry box.  That is a table consisting of two columns
	and any number of rows.  The first column specifies the
	discrete random values and the second column the probabilities
	for them.  The discrete random values do not have to be
	numbers, for example, strings will do as well.  The sum of the
	probabilities in the second column should be one.  For
	example, if you have the values A, B, C, and D in A1:A4 and
	values 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.3 in B1:B4, you could specify
	value and probability input range to be A1:B4.</para>

        <para>For Normal random distribution, specify the mean and the
	standard deviation.  The default values for them are 0 for
	mean and 1 for standard deviation.</para>

        <para>For Bernoulli random distribution, specify the ``p
        Value''.  This is a probability value between 0 and 1.
        Bernoulli distribution has two random values 0 and 1, and the
        ``p Value'' specifies the probability of value 1.  The mean of
        a random variable that has a Bernoulli distribution is E(X) =
        1(p) + 0(1-p) = p, and the variance is var(X) = p(1-p).</para>

        <para>For Uniform random distribution, specify the range of
        the random variables by filling the ``Between:'' and ``And:''
        entries.  The default values for them are 0 and 1 that gives
        random numbers between zero and one.</para>
