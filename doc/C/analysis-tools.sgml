     <title>ANOVA: Single Factor Tool</title>

     <para>Use this tool to perform a single factor analysis of the
     variances of given variables. The variables are specified by the
     `Input Range:' entry.  The given range can be grouped into the variables either
     by columns, by rows or by areas.  The `Alpha:' entry specifies the 
     significance level which is by default 5&#037;.</para>

     <para>If the first row or first column of the given range, or the 
     first field of each area contains labels, check the `Labels' button. The names of 
     the variables will be included in the  output table.</para>

     <para>The results of this analysis of variance are presented in 
     a standard ANOVA table. The `F critical'
     value is the largest value of F that is statistically significant

     <title>Moving Average Tool</title>

     <para>Use the moving average tool to calculate moving averages of
     the data set.  A moving average provides useful trend information
     of the data that is lost in a simple average.  In addition,
     moving averages can be used to eliminate random variance.  For
     example, use this tool to create a smoother curve of a stock
     prize.</para>

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the cells containing the
     values whose moving averages you want to calculate in the `Input
     Range' entry.  Then specify the `Interval' for the moving
     average.  The interval specifies the number of values to be
     included in the moving average.</para>

     <para>The results are given in a column.  Each row represents the
     moving average for the corresponding row in the input range.  The
     moving average cannot be calculated for the first `k' rows in the

     probability distributions.</para>

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the number of variables in
     the `Number of Variables:' entry box.  This determines the
     number of columns of random values to be produced.  Secondly,
     specify the number of random numbers.  This determines the number
     of rows of random values to be produced.  Thirdly specify the
     random distribution by selecting one of the list items from the
     random distribution list.  The following random distributions are
     supported: Discrete, Normal, Poisson, Exponential, Binomial,
     Negative Binomial, Bernoulli, and Uniform.  Then specify the
     parameters of the distribution.</para>

     <sect2 id="random-distributions">
        <title>Random Distributions</title>

        <para>For Discrete random distribution, specify the value and
	probability input range in the `Value and Probability Input
	Range:' entry box.  That is a table consisting of two columns
	and any number of rows.  The first column specifies the
	discrete random values and the second column the probabilities
	for them.  The discrete random values do not have to be
	numbers, for example, strings will do as well.  The sum of the
	probabilities in the second column should be one.  For
	example, if you have the values A, B, C, and D in A1:A4 and
	values 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.3 in B1:B4, you could specify
	value and probability input range to be A1:B4.</para>

        <para>For Normal random distribution, specify the mean and the
	standard deviation.  The default values for them are 0 for
	mean and 1 for standard deviation.</para>

	<para>For Poisson random distribution, specify the lambda in
	the `Lambda' entry.</para>

	<para>For Exponential random distribution, specify the b in
	the `b Value' entry.</para>

	<para>For Binomial random distribution, specify the
	probability of success in `p Value' entry.  Also specify the
	number of trials in the `Number of Trials' entry.  Binomial
	distribution is a discrete distribution in which the
	experiment consists of `n' identical trials, where `n' is
	fixed in advance.  Each trial is independent of other trials
	and has two possible outcomes, a success or a failure.  The
	probability of success is constant from one trial to another.
	The mean of a random variable that has a Binomial distribution
	is E(X) = np, and the variance is var(X) = np(1-p).</para>

	<para>For Negative Binomial distribution, specify the
	probability of success in `p Value' entry.  Also specify the
	number of failures in the `Number of Failures' entry.
	Negative Binomial distribution is a discrete distribution in
	which the experiment consists of a sequence of independent
	trials.  Each trial has two possible outcomes, a success or a
	failure.  The probability of success is constant from one
	trial to another.  The experiment continues until `r' failures
	are observed, where `r' is fixed in advance.  The mean of a
	random variable that has a Negative Binomial distribution is
	E(X) = r(1-p)/p, and the variance is var(X) =
	r(1-p)/p^2.</para>

        <para>For Bernoulli random distribution, specify the `p
        Value'.  This is a probability value between 0 and 1.
        Bernoulli distribution has two random values 0 and 1, and the
        `p Value' specifies the probability of value 1.  The mean of
        a random variable that has a Bernoulli distribution is E(X) =
        1(p) + 0(1-p) = p, and the variance is var(X) = p(1-p).</para>

        <para>For Uniform random distribution, specify the range of
        the random variables by filling the `Between:' and `And:'
        entries.  The default values for them are 0 and 1 that gives
        random numbers between zero and one.</para>

     <para>Use this tool to rank given data and to calculate the
     percentiles of each data point.   The variables for
     are specified by the `Input  Range:' entry.  
     The given range can be grouped either by columns or by rows.</para>

     <para>For each variable, the tool creates three columns in the 
     output table. The first column gives the indices of the 
     ordered data from largest to smallest data value. The second column 
     gives the corresponding data values while the third column indicates
     the percentile of each data value.</para>

     <para>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row (or column) of the given range, you should check the
     `Labels' button.  This leaves the first row (or column)  of
     the input range out of the analysis.  In addition, the names of
     the variables are printed in the output table.</para>

     <title>Sampling Tool</title>

     <para>Use the sampling tool to take a sample of a data set.  This
     tool can take both a random sample of a given size or a periodic
     sample where, for example, every fourth value of the data set is
     taken to the sample.</para>

     <para>To use this tool, first specify the data set by setting the
     `Input Range:' entry.  Then select the sampling method which
     can be either periodic or random.  Periodic sampling requires
     that you specify the period by typing a number to the `Period:'
     entry.  For example, if you specify the period to be three then
     you will get a sample that has every third value of the original
     data set.  Random sampling requires that you specify the size of
     the random sample in `Number of Samples:' entry.  The size
     cannot be larger than the original data set since each value of
     the original data set is taken at most once to the sample.</para>

     <para>Use the z-Test tool to analyze whether the means of two
     variables are significantly different or not.  The values of the
     first variable are specified in the `Variable 1 Range:' entry.
     Correspondingly, the values of the second variable are given in
     the `Variable 2 Range:' entry.  You should also specify the
     variances of both variables in the `Variable 1 Variance
     (known):' and `Variable 2 Variance (known):' entries.</para>

     <para>If you want to test whether the difference of the means is
     larger than a given value, specify also the `Hypothesized Mean
     Difference:' entry.  `Alpha:' entry specifies the level of
     significance which is by default 95&percnt;.</para>

     <para>If the output is printed into a range, it should have at
     least three columns and ten rows.</para>

     <para>The results are given in a table.  The tool calculates and
     prints the mean, known variance, and count of observations of
     both variables.  It also calculates the z-value, the one-tailed
     and two-tailed probability for the z-value, and the z Critical
     value for one-tailed and two-tailed tests.  The one-tailed
     probability for the z-value (`P(Z&lt;=z) one-tail' row) describes
     the risk of making a Type I error of one-tailed test.</para>
