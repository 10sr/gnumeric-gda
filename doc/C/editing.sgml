  <title>Strings and numbers</title>
  
  <para>The basic forms of data that can be entered into a cell include
    strings, numbers, formulas, and cell references. </para>
  
  <para>The simplest of these types are strings and numbers. They are
    just constant values that are stored in a cell. There is  no special
    syntax for this kind of data. The only limitation is that strings and
    numbers cannot contain newlines or begin with a '='. The '=' is
    used to denote cells that contain formulas or cell references.</para>
  
  <para>See <xref linkend="stringnumber"> for an example of entering
      a string.</para>

  <title>Dates and Numbers</title>

  <para>Dates and numbers are a special case of strings that are automatically
    converted to numerical types. If a string entered matches one of the formats
    for dates or times, the string is converted into a serial number (representative
    of the time in the string) and the cell format is set to that of the
    original string.</para>

  <para>To make use of this feature, the user just needs to enter in a number in
    a recognizable format. Gnumeric will automatically convert it into an appropriate serial
    number. Because of this, it is possible to enter a date or time in a human readable 
    format, and have it stored in a numerical format inside of Gnumeric.</para>

  <para>The interesting part of this is that a user entered string, can be autofilled (see 
    <xref linkend="autofill">) properly. </para>

  <para>See <xref linkend="number-format-date-time-examples"> for some examples of 
      the many date and time formats that are accepted by Gnumeric.</para>

    <para>After selecting the cell and initially entering the data, the user is in

  <title>Selecting Cells While Entering Formulas.</title>

  <para>When entering a formula into a cell, it is possible to use the
    mouse and the keyboard cursor keys to quickly enter data.</para>

  <para>There are several ways to enter a cell range into a formula. Cell
    ranges and references can be entered into a formula simply by typing in
    the proper syntax (see <xref linkend="cell-referencing"> for more details).
    But manually entering in cell ranges is slow and cumbersome. </para>

  <para>When entering data into a cell, and the cursor is at a point
    where a cell reference is appropriate, it is possible to define a cell
    reference by selecting a cell via the mouse or keyboard. This selection
    is a little different from the ordinary selection. It is highlighted
    by a "marching ants" border. </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Entering data into a formula with the mouse</title>

    <para>When entering a formula, if the cursor is at a point
      where a cell reference may be appropriate, the user just needs
      to click on a cell to automatically enter its cell reference 
      into the formula. Then finish the formula as normal.</para>

    <procedure>
      <title>Using the mouse to enter a cell reference into a formula</title>
      <step>
	<para>
	  Select a cell to enter a formula into. For example A1.
	</para>
      </step>
      <step>
	<para>Enter a formula, but stop the cursor at a point
	  where a cell reference is appropriate. For this example,
	  =exp( 
	</para>
	</step>
      <step>
	<para>
	  Now use the mouse to click on another cell to reference. For example,
	  just click on the Cell B1. Its reference will be entered into the formula
	  in cell A1.
	</para>
      </step>
      <step>
	<para>
	  To finish the formula, just type in the closing parenthesis. This will
	  also "unselect" the region.
	</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    
    <para>This can be used to select a range of cells just like regular selections. </para>

    <title>Entering data into a formula with the keyboard.</title>

    <para>If entering lots of formulas or even just entering a few formulas, it is
      often quickest to use the keyboard to select cells and ranges of cells for use
      in formulas. Just as reaching a input point allows the user to select cells 
      with the mouse, it is possible to use the keyboard to select cells. Just use 
      the cursor keys and selection modifiers to create a selection.</para>

    <procedure>
      <title>Using the keyboard to enter data into a formula.</title>

      <step>
	<para>
	  Select a cell to enter a formula into. For example A1.

      <step>
	<para>Enter a formula, but stop the cursor at a point
	  where a cell reference is appropriate. For this example,
	  =SUM( 
	</para>
      </step>
      <step>
	<para>
	  Move the selection around with the cursor keys. Move the selection
	  cursor to cell B1 to start the selection.
	</para>
      </step>
      <step>
	<para>
	  Hold down <keycap>Shift</keycap> and move the selection one cell
	over and one cell down. Cells B1,B2,C1,C2 should now be selected and
	the formula should show =sum(B1:C2 
	</para>
      </step>
      <step>
	<para>
	  To finish the function, close the parenthesis. The cell should
	  now show =sum(B1:C2). Press enter and the formula is entered.
	</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>To select a range of cell, hold <keycap>Shift</keycap> and  move over the desired area.</para>

    <para>To stop entering a selection or to start over, press <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap>
	<keycap>Backspace</keycap></keycombo></para>

  <title>Copying and moving cells</title>

      <title>Using the mouse to drag the selection</title>
    
    <para>Gnumeric allows the user to move and copy cells
      and their contents by simply dragging and dropping the
      cell to its new location. </para>

    
    <para>The basic procedure to quickly drag and drop a cell to
      a new location is to click on the border, and drag the cell
      to its new location and release. The contents of the cell
      will be moved to the new cell.</para>
    
      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>Click <mousebutton>(MB1)</mousebutton> on the border (anywhere, except the autofill square in
	    the bottom right corner).<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<mousebutton>MB1</mousebutton> 
	    copies the cell, why a plain
	    click just moves the cell.

	  <para>Drag the cell to the new cell location.</para>
