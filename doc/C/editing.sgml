  <title>Strings and numbers</title>
  
  <para>The basic forms of data that can be entered into a cell include
    strings, numbers, formulas, and cell references. </para>
  
  <para>The simplest of these types are strings and numbers. They are
    just constant values that are stored in a cell. There is  no special
    syntax for this kind of data. The only limitation is that strings and
    numbers cannot contain newlines or begin with a '='. The '=' is
    used to denote cells that contain formulas or cell references.</para>
  
  <para>See <xref linkend="stringnumber"> for an example of entering
      a string.</para>

<sect2 id="entering-dates-and-numbers">
  <title>Dates and Numbers</title>

  <para>Dates and numbers are a special case of strings that are automatically
    converted to numerical types. If a string entered matches one of the formats
    for dates or times, the string is converted into a serial number (representative
    of the time in the string) and the cell format is set to that of the
    original string.</para>

  <para>To make use of this feature, the user just needs to enter in a number in
    a recognizable format. Gnumeric will automatically convert it into an appropriate serial
    number. Because of this, it is possible to enter a date or time in a human readable 
    format, and have it stored in a numerical format inside of Gnumeric.</para>

  <para>The interesting part of this is that a user entered string, can be autofilled (see 
    <xref linkend="autofill">) properly. </para>

  <para>See <xref linkend="number-format-date-time-examples"> for some examples of 
      the many date and time formats that are accepted by Gnumeric.</para>

  <title>Selecting Cells While Entering Formulas.</title>

  <para>When entering a formula into a cell, it is possible to use the
    mouse and the keyboard cursor keys to quickly enter data.</para>

  <para>There are several ways to enter a cell range into a formula. Cell
    ranges and references can be entered into a formula simply by typing in
    the proper syntax (see <xref linkend="cell-referencing"> for more details).
    But manually entering in cell ranges is slow and cumbersome. </para>

  <para>When entering data into a cell, and the cursor is at a point
    where a cell reference is appropriate, it is possible to define a cell
    reference by selecting a cell via the mouse or keyboard. This selection
    is a little different from the ordinary selection. It is highlighted
    by a "marching ants" border. </para>
