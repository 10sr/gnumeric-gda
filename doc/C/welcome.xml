<para>
  <application>Gnumeric</application> is a spreadsheet, a computer
  program used to manipulate and analyze numeric
  data. <application>Gnumeric</application> can help you keep track of
  information in lists, organize numeric values in columns and rows,
  perform and update complex calculations by defining each step of the
  calculation and modifying particular steps subsequently, create and
  display or print graphical plots of data using bar plots, line
  graphs, pie charts or radar charts, implement complex optimization
  modeling or perform many other tasks involving numbers, dates,
  times, names or other data.

<para>
  <application>Gnumeric</application> intends to be the best
  spreadsheet available anywhere. It has been developed over many
  years to become fully mature and mathematically
  correct. <application>Gnumeric</application> was created and is
  maintained by the <ulink type="http"
  url="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</ulink> project.  This manual
  describes version 1.3 of <application>Gnumeric</application>.

    The 1.3 series of releases are unstable releases meant for
    developer testing. If you want a stable release get the most recent
    release from the 1.2 series.

<!--
<note>
  <para>
    The 1.2 series of releases are stable releases. These are only
    changed with minor improvements and fixes for problems (bugs) in
    the program. These releases can be considered safe for use in a
    production environment.

        Transparent access and manipulation of files from other
        applications is vital in a modern office. The
        <application>Gnumeric</application> file format is simply
        compressed XML which can be decompressed using
        <application>gunzip</application>, the GNU
        <application>gzip</application> program decompresser, into
        text.  <application>Gnumeric</application> can open files from
        several well known proprietary and free spreadsheets including
        MS Excel<trademark/>, Lotus 1-2-3<trademark/>,
        Applix<trademark/>, OpenOffice.org<trademark/>,
        Psion<trademark/>, Sylk<trademark/>, XBase<trademark/>,
        Oleo<trademark/>, PlanPerfect<trademark/>, Quattro
        Pro<trademark/> and HTML. <application>Gnumeric</application>
        can save files to several versions of the MS Excel<trademark/> file
        format and can save tables into LaTeX
        <markup>\longtable</markup>, HTML, and roff
        files. <application>Gnumeric</application> also benefits from
        a highly configurable text importer and exporter which ensures
        that data can be transfered smoothly, and allows new formats
        to be added easily as plug-in software routines.

      <para>
        <application>Gnumeric</application> now has enough of the
        features that users expect in a spreadsheet to provide for the
        vast majority of user needs. However, new features are
        constantly being added. People often quote the statistic that
        most users only need 20% of the features of the software they
        use. This statistic does not mean that only 20% of the
        features are needed but, rather, that most users share a
        common need for 10% of the features and require distinct
        features for the rest of their
        work. <application>Gnumeric</application> attempts to provide
        full implementations of the features it offers, leaving
        features unimplemented until a robust and complete
        implementation exists.

        url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
        software</ulink> in the sense of giving its users several
        freedoms related to the program including the freedoms to use,
        modify and redistribute the program. These freedoms are
        explained at the <ulink type="http"
        url="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</ulink> web
        site page on the <ulink type="http"

        of free software</ulink>. In order to maintain these freedoms
        for everyone, certain restrictions are required which prevent
        anyone limiting these freedom for others.
        <application>Gnumeric</application> is therefore released
        under a particular license agreement;
        <application>Gnumeric</application> is licensed under the

      <para>
        One of the consequences of these freedoms, is that everyone
        can have access to the source code used to create
        <application>Gnumeric</application>. This code is explicitly
        maintained and documented to make it easy for anyone to modify
        in any way they choose. This makes it possible to modify the

  <guilabel>The Gnumeric 1.3 Series of Releases for Developers</guilabel>
</para>

<para>
  The <application>Gnumeric</application> 1.3 series of releases are
  developer releases. These releases are kept as stable as
  possible. However, each release in this series includes changes and
  improvements some of which are quite large. These new changes may
  cause the program to crash and loose data. Do not use these releases
  if you cannot afford to loose any data or work. However, these
  releases include many new features that can be helpful. If you use
  this series, backup your data often, not just by saving files but by
  renaming them and checking that they can be reopened. If you
  experience mistakes or crashes while you are using this version,
  please report these using the GNOME project's bug reporting
  interface, called <ulink type="http"
  url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</ulink>.

      <para>
        One of the principal aims of this developers series is to make
        <application>Gnumeric</application> work using only the GTK+
        libraries. These libraries, following their 2.4.0 release,
        have all the functionality needed for the core of
        <application>Gnumeric</application>. This work will remove all
        dependencies in the core code on GNOME libraries although a
        version with the more complete features included in GNOME will
        still exist.

        statistical language, from the <ulink type="http"
        url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific

        The earlier versions of <application>Gnumeric</application>

        This version of <application>Gnumeric</application> is based
        on the second version of the Gimp Tool Kit (GTK+), the basic
        libraries of computer code used to build GNOME
        applications. This second version improves on the first and
        provides a sound basis for future programming. Users will
        benefit greatly from this second version of the GTK+
        libraries. <application>Gnumeric</application> is now able to
        produce characters from a much larger range of languages, has
        improved icons, is better integrated with GNOME and has other
        visual improvements like anti-aliased
        fonts. <application>Gnumeric</application> can also now be
        used without problem on a machine with several screens. The
        transition to GTK+ 2.0 has also greatly improved performance.
