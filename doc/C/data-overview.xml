  <title>Data in Gnumeric Cells</title>
  
  <para>
    The purpose of a spreadsheet is to manipulate data and perform
    calculations on those data. In order to understand how to use
    <application>Gnumeric</application>, it is necessary to understand
    what types of data are available and how these types can be
    manipulated.

  <para>
    Because all of the data which are entered into a
    <application>Gnumeric</application> workbook can eventually be
    stored in a file, the file contents define the kinds of data which
    can be entered into the spreadsheet. A file contains metadata
    about the file contents, global data for the workbook and the
    actual data contents of the workbook. The metadata include a brief
    document summary describing the file contents and include the
    settings applicable to the data contents, such as the settings for
    the printing of each sheet and any settings for automatically
    saving the file. The global data for the workbook include any
    names which are defined by the user and attributes, such as the
    protected status of the workbook and sheets. The actual data are
    contained in the worksheets and include the contents of the cells,
    both data and formatting, and other objects such as drawing and
    charts.

    This chapter describes the information which can be stored in
    spreasheet cells. This includes the five types of data which cells
    can contain and the formatting which can be applied to each
    cell. The chapter first describes the five data types available,
    then describes the formatting which can be performed on each cell,
    then explains how data can be inserted into a spreadsheet and
    finally describes how to copy and move data around a worksheet
    along with the transformations which can be performed as the data
    are moved. This chapter does not describe other types of data
    which can be stored in a spreadsheet such as drawing elements and
    graphs used to chart data. These are explained in latter chapters.
