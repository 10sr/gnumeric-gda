  <title>AutoFill</title>
  
  <para>When dealing with spreadsheets it's pretty typical to want to
    add a set of cells that contain a series of numbers or dates or other
    values. While this can be done by hand, Gnumeric implements an autofill
    option to allow these sorts of series to be easily filled in.</para>
  
  <para>A typical example of when you want to use this feature is to fill
    a series of numbers, maybe a list of part numbers, or a perhaps a list
    of TV channels. To create a list like this, all the user needs to do
    is to enter the first number into a cell, click on the autofill
    cursor in the bottom right corner of the cell border, and finally drag it in
    the direction to fill. If the first cell contains a '1', for example,
    dragging the autofill button(see <xref linkend="celltobautofilled">) down three or four cells
      will fill the cells with '1','2','3', and '4' automatically.(see <xref linkend="cellsautofilled">)</para>

  <para>As handy as being able to simply and quickly generate series of 
    numbers incremented by one is, autofill can do much much more. The next simplest
    example is autofilling with a series using an increment other than 1. For example,
    to create a series that consist of odd numbers starting at 11, just enter 
	'11' into
    a cell and '13' into the next cell. Then select both cells, and stretch the 
selection in order to 
    cover the cells to be filled. If you select the next 5 cells, for example, 
    they will be filled with values '15','17','19','21', and '23.' See <xref linkend="seedcellautofillsequence">
      and  <xref linkend="autofillsequence"> for example.</para>

    <title>Filling with Dates</title>
    
    <para>Oh, but numbers are easy you say! The real painful stuff is entering
      dates and times and other information. But never fear, Gnumeric is there
      to help you. Gnumeric has the ability to autofill dates, months, days of the week,
      and more. </para>
    
   <para> As an example, think of a typical business invoice, where everything is
      logged by the month. So it is quite typical to want to fill a series of cells
      with the months of the year in order. To do this is quite simple, essentially the
      same steps as making a numerical fill.</para>
    
    <para>Starting from cell B2, for example, to fill the next 12 cells
      with the months, just enter the string "January" in B2. Then, click the fill button
      and stretch it over the next 12 cells, and release. It is as simple as that. See <xref
	linkend="datefillseed">, <xref linkend="datebeingfilled">, and 
	  <xref linkend="cellsfilled">. </para>

    <para> Other examples of strings that can be autofilled include days of
      the week (Monday, Tuesday,...), short weekdays (Mon, Tues, ....),
      and short months (Jan, Feb,...) </para>

    <para>Gnumeric tries to be intelligent about autofilling number values that
      embedded into text strings. So its possible to autofill cells with values
      like "9 lives to live","8 lives to live", etc. </para>

    <para>Probably the most useful of all the autofill capabilities is
      the ability to autofill functions. In practice it works essentially the
      same as all the other autofill methods; it just transfers the functions.

    <para>In the formula example above there were only a few rows to
    fill with the new formula.  For larger spread sheets dragging out
    a new formula can be cumbersome.  An alternative is to let
    gnumeric do the work for you.
    </para>
   
    <procedure>
    <step performance="required">
      <para>Enter the formula in the top cell of the new column.</para></step>
   
    <step performance="required">
      <para>Double click on the small rectangle in the bottom right
            corner of the cell.</para></step>
   
    <step performance="required">
      <para>Gnumeric will look at the column to the left and find the
      first blank cell in that column.  It will then fill the new
      column with your formula all the way down to the blank
      cell.</para></step>
   
    </procedure>

    <para>Double click together with the meta key will do automagic
    filling of rows instead of columns.</para>
