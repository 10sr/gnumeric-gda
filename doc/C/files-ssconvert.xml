    &gnum; can convert files automatically without needing user
    intervention. This allows a large number of files to be converted
    using a script. &gnum; is distributed along with a program called
    <application>ssconvert</application> which is the program used to
    convert files automatically. All of the file formats supported by
    &gnum; can be used except for the Postscript and PDF file formats
    which operate through the printing system.
