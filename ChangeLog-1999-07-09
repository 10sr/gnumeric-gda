	* src/*: Dropped the ColInfo and RowInfo structures, they are now
	unified into a single ColRowInfo structure, they were really the
	same thing.  Thanks to Federico for the suggestion.

	* src/item-grid.c: 
	New paint strategy for the grid (uses what apparently Excel does);
	It now correctly uses the coordinate system from the canvas (ie,
	zoom in and zoom out work);
	
	* src/item-cursor.c: Implemented new version of the cursor.  I am
	using black lines for the cursor.  One day, when I find the
	strenght, I will use inversion and the inversion will do the right
	thing.

	* src/item-bar.c: New file.  Implements the titles for the columns
	and rows;

	* src/*: made stuff fit together.
