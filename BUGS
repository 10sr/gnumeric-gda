issues that need to be addressed.  Divided into, things that will prevent
release, and longer term bugs.

UTF-8:
    - Window titles.
    - format precompile

Possibly Post 1.2 Targets
-------------------------
- pivot tables
- validation from list (generalize filter combos)
- clipboard handlers in plugins
- input message				(Stored)
- Put a pango layout in rendered value
- load/save of external references

Probably Post 1.2 Targets
-------------------------
- eggmenu (would be nice to slide in to support merging from non-bonobo build)
- finish corba plugin
- conditional formats : could be done if someone wanted to work on the dialog
- scripting
- undo/redo transaction file
- drawing rotated borders

Excel i/o
    - 'Forms' import.

Misc stuff that should be fixed
-------------------------------

- Oleo formulae contains spaces and now break.  (Try demo.oleo.)

- Missing undo/redo for
    - Freeze panes (tricky this is a view attribute)
    - Duplicate sheet.
    - Remove sheet. This raises some serious design issues.
    - Goal seek.
    - Tabulate.
    - Sheet object configuration changes.
    - Sheet object creation
    - Workbook attr changes

- Evaluate mathfunc.c's use of gamma and lgamma.  We use the libc lgamma
  (probably ok) and have gamma(x)=exp(lgamma(x)) (questionable).
- We need to somehow add --export-dynamic to the gnumeric link line, or else
  plugins won't load on Solaris/gcc.  (This might just be my bastard libtool.)

- Remove duplication of code between analysis-tools.c and collect.c

- Make deletion work for multiple ranges.

- Add dirty flags to workbook too, adding a sheet should make workbook dirty
  not the new sheet.

- Audit all fixed-length buffers.  Most non-time-critical can be replaced
  by proper usage of g_strdup_printf.

- The autocalc label should use a more readable format and should not get
  clipped.

- Names
    : references in names do not get changed with cut/paste or ins/del row/col.
      How to handle relative references in names ?? here.
    : Dialog
	* We should start with the expr entry set to either the current cell,
	  or by selecting the first named expression in scope that contains the
	  current cell.
    : Check scoping changes.
    : Is there such a thing as an array formula in a name ?
    : Handle pasting an expression with an un-qualified sheet local name into
      another sheet

- can_try_save_to uses access().  That's bogus in a number of ways: (a) it
  checks the wrong permissions in the set[gu]id case.  (b) It reports the
  wrong result if the path is not readable.  The Right Way to do this, is
  just to do it.  And then check the error code.

- hidden rows/cols
    : Make unhide smarter to find hidden regions on either side of selected ranges.

- clean up the range_list codes to differentiate a list of ranges from a list
  of cellranges.

- In selected regions the borders of cells that
  have their background color set are drawn incorrectly.
  An off-by-one pixel problem. For details see :
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52240

- The max row/col canvas scroll size is still hard coded.

- Formats
    : support negative durations with [h]
    : Why does the number matching bother comparing against formats that are
      covered by 'General' ?
    : format.c: we should resolve all the separators at gnumeric_setlocale time,
      not every time we need them.
    : When applying a currency symbol we need to store the NON-localized id.
    : hour month and year format strings need to be internationalized.
	eg tt:ss instead of hh:ss for other locales.
    : formats with AM/PM need to be internationalized.
    : we should parse fractions
    : We do not format fractional seconds correctly.
    : Parsing should handle embedded strings
    : It incorrectly accepts mmm:ss as some sort of minute spec.

- Inc/Dec precision should work.  Try "44", click $, then add/remove decimals.
- While we're playing with those functions, let's add simple ones like inc/dec
  font size and things like that.

- locale : Saving xml should not rely on changing the textdomain to
           disable translation of TRUE/FALSE in expressions.
	 : Support parsing and displaying locale specific function
	   names.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.

- auto-fill does not resize row/col

- Styles
    : improve uniform_get to handle full sheet more quickly.
    : Borders
	* use new border code for cell format dialog (possibly preview-grid)

- SheetObjects
    : Add acetate_create virtual to handle shaped objects.
    : Other anchor types for sheet objects
    : Add keyboard controls for the control points
    : Add object control for resize to disable invalid sizes.
    : Add 'is_printable' flag and import
    : research the other xl object flags.

Dialogs
-------
- Formula Guru
    : Fix keyboard interface

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Function range_min_k uses an O(n*log n) algorithm.  It should use O(n)
  algorithm, see Knuth.
- Functions like SUMPRODUCT need to have better support for sparse ranges.
  We should probably create synchronously_walk_ranges.  (XL goes kaboom on
  large ranges also, but we ought to be smarter.)

Printing
--------
- cell text wraps differently when printing than displaying due to scaling
  differences in font size.  do we want to eliminate this ?

Plugins
-------
- i18n support for third-party plugins.
- Add extra info (authors, etc.) to XML file.
- Beautify ErrorInfo dialog (it's ugly).
- Mark plugin as "broken" if deactivation failed.
- mps
    : has some fixed-length arrays that can be overrun.
    : creates formulae by making strings and then parsing them.
      (Wasteful and won't work in non-C locales.)
