A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- gnumeric depends on unreleased gnome-print
- gnumeric depends on unreleased bonobo
- text in print-preview is vertically offset.

Long term breakage
------------------
- border style double_line does handle all of the different intersection cases.
- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.
- Need to ensure that selecting cell ranges for formulas keep extension visible
  and restores it when done.
