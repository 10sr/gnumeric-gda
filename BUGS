A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- Seletion in the font name combo is broken.
- Changing an expression name that is in use causes a crash.
- The max row/col canvas scroll size is still hard coded.
- Resize row/col undo is unfinished.
- Saving xml should not rely on changing the textdomain to disable translation
  of TRUE/FALSE.

Long term breakage
------------------
- Increase/Decrease precision toolbar buttons should look at the displayed
  precision for the edit cell and assign the changed value to the entire
  selection.  Not individually adjusting each non-blank cell's precision.
  This would mirror the application of bold/italic/underline

- Moreover, the above buttons ought to work.  Try "44", click $, then add
  and remove decimals.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.
- The implication of mixed mode references ($B$2:C3)
  is large.  All accesses to a RangeRef need to be normalized. (1/2 done)

- border style double_line does not handle all of the different intersection cases.

- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.

- when guessing the format of a possible value we should try the format
  associated with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without
  quotes) in a cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as
  text.  Instead It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- The File->Print Preview icon is too big.  Use the stock version when the next
  release of gnome-libs is made. (tigert is adding to gnome-libs)

- Names : Sheet local vs workbook local vs application global (does that exist ?)
	: addresses not changing with row/col ins/del.

- All forms of autoscroll should use the timer mechanism from item-grid.
- The auto scroll timer from item-grid needs to move to sheet-view.

- Underline should scale with font size.  (Say, min (1, font->descent/4?)
  gnome-print has a function we could use for printing which returns the
  underline thickness.

- auto-fill does not resize row/col

- Some number formats are being written in their native locale.  Breaking things when
  they are reloaded in other locales.

Dialogs
-------
- Finish function wizard
- Use color combos in format dialog.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.
- Sumif  : mis-handles blanks.
- ftest : Needs auditing.  All calls to eval_pos_init_cellref are questionable.
- sumproduct : bug 12042

Printing
--------
- cell text wraps differently when printing than displaying due to scaling
  differences in font size.  do we want to eliminate this ?

Widget polishing
----------------
- gtk-combo-text
    : a value entered directly in the edit field does not handle selection in
      the list correctly

- Add row (rows ?) for custom colours in the color combo dialog.
