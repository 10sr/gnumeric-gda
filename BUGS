A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- Changing the size of all rows/cols creates big xml files.
- Saving xml should not rely on changing the textdomain to disable translation
  of TRUE/FALSE.

Long term breakage
------------------
- Changing an expression name that is in use does not recalc, or regen depends
  correctly.
- The max row/col canvas scroll size is still hard coded.

- Increase/Decrease precision toolbar buttons should look at the displayed
  precision for the edit cell and assign the changed value to the entire
  selection.  Not individually adjusting each non-blank cell's precision.
  This would mirror the application of bold/italic/underline
- Moreover, the above buttons ought to work.  Try "44", click $, then add
  and remove decimals.
- While we're playing with those functions, lets add simple ones like inc/dec
  font size and things like that.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.
- auto-fill does not resize row/col

- The implication of mixed mode references ($B$2:C3)
  is large.  All accesses to a RangeRef need to be normalized. (1/2 done)

- border style double_line does not handle all of the different intersection cases.

- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.

- when guessing the format of a possible value we should try the format
  associated with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without
  quotes) in a cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as
  text.  Instead It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- Some number formats are being written in their native locale.  Breaking things when
  they are reloaded in other locales.

- The File->Print Preview icon is too big.  Use the stock version when the next
  release of gnome-libs is made. (tigert is adding to gnome-libs)

- Names : Sheet local vs workbook local vs application global (does that exist ?)
	: addresses not changing with row/col ins/del.

- Underline should scale with font size.  (Say, max (1, font->descent/4?)
  gnome-print has a function we could use for printing which returns the
  underline thickness.

- Error handling is completely hosed.  We currently save the value of a cell
  as a string.  This means that we need to be able to parse that a value is an
  error.  Currently this only works for the standard errors.
  eg  value_error_new("1+3") will print the string 1+3 as the error.
      Something more comprehensive is necessary.

- Functions like SUMPRODUCT need to have better support for sparse ranges.
  We should probably create synchroneously_walk_ranges.  (XL goes kaboom on
  large ranges also, but we ought to be smarter.)

Dialogs
-------
- Use color combos in format dialog.
- Function selector
    : 'Most recently used'
    : typing in the function list should jump to an entry that starts with the
      requested letter.
- Formula Guru
    : As we auto add new entries for varargs we should make them visible.
    : Editing nested functions.  How best to express this.
    : Switching between multiple function at the same level.
    : Better communication and handling of parse errors.

Sorting
-------
    - Hidden rows/cols should not be sorted.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.
- ftest : Needs auditing.  All calls to eval_pos_init_cellref are questionable.
- address : This code is a duplicate.  Have the function use the standard routines.

Printing
--------
- cell text wraps differently when printing than displaying due to scaling
  differences in font size.  do we want to eliminate this ?
- headers and footers should be clipped

Widget polishing
----------------
- Selection for the undo/redo combo is ugly
