A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- Selection highlighting of spanning columns draws columns outside the selection
  range as if they were selected.

Long term breakage
------------------
- border style double_line does not respect the background colour of the cell
  being painted.

- border style double_line does handle all of the different intersection cases.

- Borders above below cells spanning cols are lost.
