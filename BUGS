A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- Changing the size of a selected column by dragging does not redraw properly.
- Changing the size of a selected column by dragging when there are several selected
  does not work properly.

Long term breakage
------------------
- changing col/row sizes does not have undo support.
- The implication of mixed mode references ($B$2:C3)
  is large.  We need to validate references when pasting a
  copy to check for inversion.

- Copy with destination larger than source does not duplicate the styles.

- border style double_line does handle all of the different intersection cases.

- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.

- when guess the format of a possible value we should try the format associated
  with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without quotes) in a
  cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as text.  Instead
  It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- The File->Print Preview icon is too big.  Use the stock version when the next
  release of gnome-libs is made. (tigert is adding to gnome-libs)

- Names : sheet vs workbook, addresses not changing with row/col ins/del.

- All forms of autoscroll should use the timer mechanism from item-grid.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Match  : does not support match_type +-1
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.

Widget polishing
----------------
- gtk-combo-text
    : a value entered directly in the edit field does not handle selection in
      the list correctly
    : the list does not auto scroll.
