A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------

Long term breakage
------------------
- Copy with destination larger than source does not duplicate the styles.
- Cut/Paste of a cell with bold onto a cell with underline yields a cell with
  both ??

- border style double_line does handle all of the different intersection cases.

- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.

- when guess the format of a possible value we should try the format associated
  with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without quotes) in a
  cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as text.  Instead
  It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- The File->Print Preview icon is too big.  Use the stock version when the next
  release of gnome-libs is made. (tigert is adding to gnome-libs)

- non string values entered directly are not really editable in that we
  may not be able to parse the formated version.
  eg value = 90, format = '[$USD] 0.00'
     We put the FORMATTED result (USD 90.00) into the edit region.

- Names : sheet vs workbook, addresses not changing with row/col ins/del.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Match  : does not support match_type +-1
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.

Widget polishing
----------------
- gtk-combo-text
    : a value entered directly in the edit field does not handle selection in
      the list correctly
