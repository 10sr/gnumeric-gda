To report Gnumeric bugs, please visit bugzilla.gnome.org.

This file is used as a scratch pad by developers.  It is a list of known
issues that need to be addressed.  Divided into, things that will prevent
release, and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------

- figure out why error dialogs at startup get forced behind workbook

1.2 Targets
-----------

1) graphs
2) stf
3) finish hlink dialog
4) finish support for h/v only splits
5) zip based format
    5.1) move existing code into plugin
    5.2) work on sax style exporter
    5.3) extend api for gnm_expr_as_string to handle 1.0 vs 1.1 style rangerefs
    5.4) should extend the format api to contain (not support) all of the
        opencalc flags.
6) XL
    6.1) 97 export
    6.2) Form import
    6.3) Intersection, union and set export
    6.4) unknown name export
    6.5) non-ole import ?
8) Notice mismatch between suffix and saver (eg .xls for gnumeric file)
9) Manual recalc
    9.1) finish calculation ui in workbook attr dialog
10) fix highlighting of completion code
11) look into using the default gtk font rather than our own
12) audit all of the import plugins to do utf8 conversions
13) Reinstate auto-format (=FV(1,2,3,4,5) should yield a monetary format).
14) merge open and import dialogs
15) finish corba plugin
16) eggmenu
17) Decide whether to turn on the poor man's utf8 regexps.

UTF-8 :
    - Audit string functions for utf8: CHAR, CODE, SUBSTITUTE, SEARCH.
    - Recent files in "File" menu.
    - Error messages (notably when files names are present).
    - Window titles.
    - function_category_compare

Pending Patches
---------------
    - regexp based accounting format characterization
    - ?? more work on D&D based sheet reorg ?

Probably Post 1.2 Targets
-------------------------
- conditional formats : could be done if someone wanted to work on the dialog
- pivots and scripting
- undo/redo transaction file
- load/save of external references

Misc stuff that should be fixed
-------------------------------

- Missing undo/redo for
    - Duplicate sheet.
    - Remove sheet. This raises some serious design issues.
    - Freeze panes.
    - Goal seek.
    - Tabulate.
    - Sheet object configuration changes.
    - Sheet object creation
    - Workbook attr changes

- Evaluate mathfunc.c's use of gamma and lgamma.  We use the libc lgamma
  (probably ok) and have gamma(x)=exp(lgamma(x)) (questionable).
- We need to somehow add --export-dynamic to the gnumeric link line, or else
  plugins won't load on Solaris/gcc.  (This might just be my bastard libtool.)
- 3D reference fixes on sheet deletion
- Dependencies for constructed ranges
- 'discard' for invalid expressions enters text as string
- Fix workbook_sheet_by_name with respect to letter case and utf-8.

- Remove duplication of code between analysis-tools.c and collect.c

- Make deletion work for multiple ranges.

- Most arg-type functions need to be somehow marked as strict.  Checking for
  errors by hand everywhere is silly.  (This is at least partially done.)
    : It is tempting to 

- Add dirty flags to workbook too, adding a sheet should make workbook dirty
  not the new sheet.

- Audit all fixed-length buffers.  Most non-time-critical can be replaced
  by proper usage of g_strdup_printf.

- The autocalc label should use a more readable format and should not get
  clipped.

- Names
    : references in names do not get changed with cut/paste or ins/del row/col.
      How to handle relative references in names ?? here.
    : Dialog
	* We should start with the expr entry set to either the current cell,
	  or by selecting the first named expression in scope that contains the
	  current cell.
	* Should <ok> add the name ?
    : Check xl import of unicode names
    : Check scoping changes.

- can_try_save_to uses access().  That's bogus in a number of ways: (a) it
  checks the wrong permissions in the set[gu]id case.  (b) It reports the
  wrong result if the path is not readable.  The Right Way to do this, is
  just to do it.  And then check the error code.

- gnumeric_error_invalid change call sequence to use printf argument style.

- outline mode
    : finish implementing optionally putting markers above/left
    : Make ungroup smarter about handling extra items of lower level at the edges
    : implement 'clicked' for numbers callbacks (requires cleanup in the collapse code)

- hidden rows/cols
    : Make unhide smarter to find hidden regions on either side of selected ranges.

- clean up the range_list codes to differentiate a list of ranges from a list
  of cellranges.

- In selected regions the borders of cells that
  have their background color set are drawn incorrectly.
  An off-by-one pixel problem. For details see :
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52240

- The max row/col canvas scroll size is still hard coded.

- Formats
    : support negative durations with [h]
    : Why does the number matching bother comparing against formats that are
      covered by 'General' ?
    : format.c: we should resolve all the separators at gnumeric_setlocale time,
      not every time we need them.
    : the format classification should know about other currencies and currency
      placements.
    : The currency list in the format dialog needs to be sorted for the locale
    : When applying a currency symbol we need to store the NON-localized id.
    : hour month and year format strings need to be internationalized.
	eg tt:ss instead of hh:ss for other locales.
    : formats with AM/PM need to be internationalized.
    : we should parse fractions
    : We do not format fractional seconds correctly.
    : Parsing should handle embedded strings

- Inc/Dec precision should work.  Try "44", click $, then add/remove decimals.
- While we're playing with those functions, let's add simple ones like inc/dec
  font size and things like that.

- locale : Saving xml should not rely on changing the textdomain to
           disable translation of TRUE/FALSE in expressions.
	 : Support parsing and displaying locale specific function
	   names.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.

- auto-fill does not resize row/col

- Styles
    : improve uniform_get to handle full sheet more quickly.
    : Borders
	* use new border code for cell format dialog (possibly preview-grid)
    : Underline
	* should scale with font size.  (Say, max (1, font->descent/4?)
	  gnome-print has a function we could use for printing which returns the
	  underline thickness.
	* Should be visible in the edit-item (should edit item use cell_draw ?)

- SheetObjects
    : Add acetate_create virtual to handle shaped objects.
    : Other anchor types for sheet objects
    : Add keyboard controls for the control points
    : Add object control for resize to disable invalid sizes.
    : Add 'is_printable' flag and import
    : research the other xl object flags.

Dialogs
-------
- Formula Guru
    : Fix keyboard interface
- Import Dialog
    : Rewrite main page preview (see Bug #66393)

Function Breakage
-----------------
- There are a number of #UNIMPLEMENTED! things to take care of in the
    financial functions.  Mostly this is due to incomplete documentation.
- Function range_min_k uses an O(n*log n) algorithm.  It should use O(n)
  algorithm, see Knuth.
- Functions like SUMPRODUCT need to have better support for sparse ranges.
  We should probably create synchronously_walk_ranges.  (XL goes kaboom on
  large ranges also, but we ought to be smarter.)

Printing
--------
- cell text wraps differently when printing than displaying due to scaling
  differences in font size.  do we want to eliminate this ?

Plugins
-------
- i18n support for third-party plugins.
- Add extra info (authors, etc.) to XML file.
- Beautify ErrorInfo dialog (it's ugly).
- Mark plugin as "broken" if deactivation failed.
- mps
    : has some fixed-length arrays that can be overrun.
    : creates formulae by making strings and then parsing them.
      (Wasteful and won't work in non-C locales.)
