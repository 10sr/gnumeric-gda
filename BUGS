To report Gnumeric bugs, please visit bugzilla.gnome.org.

This file is used as a scratch pad by developers.  It is a list of know
issues that need to be addressed.  Divided into, things that will prevent
release, and longer term bugs.


Release Critical
----------------

    - Sheet objects
		: panes
		: ctrl points
    - Panes : item-cursor handling of drag handle.  We should only move it to the top if the
	      bottom is not visible in any pane.
	    : xml persistence

    - Span : C3 : "spanning text"  C4 : '=A2' span not broken
	probable cause,  we don't calculate the span of the expression,
	hence we don't break the old span.

    - content in A1 and B1, cursor on B1, double click on cursor drag box, fill column
	: should not fill
	: clearing 64k expressions from a column is dog slow

    - 57372

    - The evolution check is broken.  We should check for "idl/Evolution-Composer.h"
      because we use it in workbook-control-gui.c.  Moreover, the idl check currently
      in configure.in should be run-time, not compile time.


Pending Patches
---------------

Long term breakage
------------------

- Panes 
    : Make ctrl-arrow smarter in the presence of panes.
    : change semantics of freeze operation to clarify where to freeze
      (is edit bottom-right of freeze or top left of unfrozen)
    : GUI handling of freezing center if the current pos it at the top left.
    : XL persistence

- support negative durations with [h]

- Functions like SMALL and LARGE use O(n*log n) algorithms.  Should use
  O(n) algorithms, see Knuth.

- outline mode
    : finish implementing optionally putting markers above/left
    : connect the hide/show menu items

- Version the idl file so that future versions will not be confused by attempts
  to use an older version of the idl.

- It is possible to navigate to hidden cols/rows at the start/end of the sheet.

- clean up the range_list codes to differentiate a list of ranges from a list
  of cellranges.

Names :
    : Fix XL named expr import for sheet local names
      * externsheet for biff7 type=3
      * test for unicode
    : Changing an expression name that is in use does not recalc, or regen
      depends correctly.
    : references in names do not get changed with cut/paste or ins/del row/col.

- When using the new range-selector for dialogs with only one range, it
  should not be necessary to select the range field before selecting the
  range.  As long as the selector is in a modal dialog.

- In selected regions the borders of cells that
  have their background color set are drawn incorrectly.
  An off-by-one pixel problem. For details see :
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52240

- Search-and-replace.
  - It is doubtful whether the regexp selection belongs on the first page.
  - Querying is not implemented.

- The max row/col canvas scroll size is still hard coded.
- scrollbar sizes are based on rows/cols rather than visible pixels
- scrollbar size includes hidden rows/cols

- calculated cells do not span.

- Why does the number matching bother comparing against formats that are
  covered by 'General' ?

- format.c: we should resolve all the separators at gnumeric_setlocale time,
  not every time we need them.

- when guessing the format of a possible value we should try the format
  associated with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without
  quotes) in a cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as
  text.  Instead It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.
  PARTIAL : we need to merge the StyleFormat and the regexp.  Currently only
  	works for Text formats.

- The currency list in the format dialog needs to be sorted for the locale
- When applying a currency symbol we need to store the NON-localized id.
- Inc/Dec precision should work.  Try "44", click $, then add/remove decimals.
- While we're playing with those functions, let's add simple ones like inc/dec
  font size and things like that.

- locale : Saving xml should not rely on changing the textdomain to
           disable translation of TRUE/FALSE in expressions.
	 : Support parsing and displaying locale specific function
	   names.

- formats with AM/PM need to be internationalized.
- hour month and year format strings need to be internationalized.
    eg tt:ss instead of hh:ss for other locales.

- We do not format fractional seconds correctly.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.

- auto-fill does not resize row/col

- The implication of mixed mode references ($B$2:C3)
  is large.  All accesses to a RangeRef need to be normalized. (1/2 done)

- Styles
    - improve uniform_get to handle full sheet more quickly.
    - Borders
	- use new border code for cell format dialog (possibly preview-grid)
    - Underline
	- should scale with font size.  (Say, max (1, font->descent/4?)
	  gnome-print has a function we could use for printing which returns the
	  underline thickness.
	- Should be visible in the edit-item (should edit item use cell_draw ?)

- Functions like SUMPRODUCT need to have better support for sparse ranges.
  We should probably create synchronously_walk_ranges.  (XL goes kaboom on
  large ranges also, but we ought to be smarter.)

- latex : multiline rows not handled properly.
        : nor are spans

- SheetObjects
    : Add acetate_create virtual to handle shaped objects.
    : config dialog for arrows and graphic objects (set colour)
    : Other anchor types for sheet objects
    : Add keyboard controls for the control points

Dialogs
-------
- Function selector
    : 'Most recently used'
    : typing in the function list should jump to an entry that starts with the
      requested letter.
- Formula Guru
    : As we auto add new entries for varargs we should make them visible.
    : Editing nested functions.  How best to express this.
    : Switching between multiple function at the same level.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Index : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.
- address : This code is a duplicate.  Have the function use the standard
    routines.
- There are a number of #UNIMPLEMENTED! things to take care of in the
    financial functions.  Mostly this is due to incomplete documentation.

Printing
--------
- cell text wraps differently when printing than displaying due to scaling
  differences in font size.  do we want to eliminate this ?

Widget polishing
----------------
- extensions to the notebook to enable dragging a tab to reorder and copy
- Add an optional flag to GnumericExprEntry which forces single-cell-only
  selection.

Plugins
-------
- i18n support for third-party plugins.
- Add extra info (authors, etc.) to XML file.
- Plugin manager: add "refresh list" button.
- Plugin manager: add GUI for adding extra directories with plugins.
- Beautify ErrorInfo dialog (it's ugly).
- Mark plugin as "broken" if deactivation failed.
