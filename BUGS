A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- gnumeric depends on unreleased bonobo
- gnumeric depends on unreleased gnome-print
- text in print-preview is vertically offset (lewing has a patch for gnome-print)
- print-preview is not cleared between pages.

Long term breakage
------------------
- border style double_line does handle all of the different intersection cases.
- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.
- when guess the format of a possible value we should try the format associated
  with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without quotes) in a
  cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as text.  Instead
  It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- File->Print Preview does not have an icon.

- non string values entered directly are not really editable in that we
  may not be able to parse the formated version.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Match  : does not support match_type +-1
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.
