A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------
- Parser : The single character '%' is parsed as an expression '0%'

- format.c: we should resolve all the separators at gnumeric_setlocale time,
  not every time we need them.

- when guessing the format of a possible value we should try the format
  associated with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without
  quotes) in a cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as
  text.  Instead It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- We should put the sensitization/desensitization of the toolbars
  on a timer/idle hander so that it will not trigger until a second
  or so after the edit starts/ends.  This will decrease the irritating
  flashing when entering data quickly.
- The currency list in the format dialog needs to be sorted for the locale
- When applying a currency symbol we need to store the NON-localized id.
- Increase/Decrease precision toolbar buttons should look at the displayed
  precision for the edit cell and assign the changed value to the entire
  selection.  Not individually adjusting each non-blank cell's precision.
  This would mirror the application of bold/italic/underline
- Moreover, the above buttons ought to work.  Try "44", click $, then add
  and remove decimals.
- While we're playing with those functions, lets add simple ones like inc/dec
  font size and things like that.
- Copy sheet, and insert new sheet both append to the end of the sheet list
  rather than inserting before the current sheet.

- Model View Controller
- Fix Borders

Long term breakage
------------------
STF - pasting a single line should not invoke the importer

- locale : Saving xml should not rely on changing the textdomain to
           disable translation of TRUE/FALSE in expressions.
	 : Support parsing and displaying locale specific function
	   names.

- formats with AM/PM need to be internationalized.

- Changing an expression name that is in use does not recalc, or regen depends
  correctly.

- references in names do not get changed with cut/paste or ins/del row/col.

- We do not format fractional seconds correctly.

- The max row/col canvas scroll size is still hard coded.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.

- auto-fill does not resize row/col

- The implication of mixed mode references ($B$2:C3)
  is large.  All accesses to a RangeRef need to be normalized. (1/2 done)

- border style double_line does not handle all of the different intersection cases.

- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.

- The File->Print Preview icon is too big.  Use the stock version when the next
  release of gnome-libs is made.

- Underline should scale with font size.  (Say, max (1, font->descent/4?)
  gnome-print has a function we could use for printing which returns the
  underline thickness.

- Functions like SUMPRODUCT need to have better support for sparse ranges.
  We should probably create synchronously_walk_ranges.  (XL goes kaboom on
  large ranges also, but we ought to be smarter.)

- latex : multiline rows not handled properly.
        : nor are spans

- SheetObjects  : use GtkArg and remove cruft from xml-io.
	 	: Add data member to Class to indicate 'simple' object
		  types that can be rubber banded directly.
		: Add bounding_box_add
		      bounding_box_remove
		  to handle shaped objects.

Dialogs
-------
- Use color combos in format dialog.
- Function selector
    : 'Most recently used'
    : typing in the function list should jump to an entry that starts with the
      requested letter.
- Formula Guru
    : As we auto add new entries for varargs we should make them visible.
    : Editing nested functions.  How best to express this.
    : Switching between multiple function at the same level.
    : Better communication and handling of parse errors.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.
- ftest : Needs auditing.  All calls to eval_pos_init_cellref are questionable.
- address : This code is a duplicate.  Have the function use the standard routines.

Printing
--------
- cell text wraps differently when printing than displaying due to scaling
  differences in font size.  do we want to eliminate this ?

Widget polishing
----------------
- Selection for the undo/redo combo is ugly
