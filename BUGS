A list of know issues that need to be addressed.
Divided into, things that will prevent release,
and longer term bugs.

Release Critical
----------------

- gnumeric_countif
  gnumeric_sumif : Comment and code do not agree, who is right.

- gnumeric_sumx2my2
  gnumeric_sumx2py2
  gnumeric_sumxmy2 : These do not handle blank cells.

- gnumeric_ftest : Needs auditing.  All calls to eval_pos_init_cellref
  are questionable.

Long term breakage
------------------
- The max row/col scroll size is still hard coded.

- Increase/Decrease precision toolbar buttons should look at the displayed
  precision for the edit cell and assign the changed value to the entire
  selection.  Not individually adjusting each non-blank cell's precision.

- Auto resize needs to handle empty cells.
- Clearing a cell that stopped a span does not regenerate the span.
- changing col/row sizes does not have undo support.
- The implication of mixed mode references ($B$2:C3)
  is large.  We need to validate references when pasting a
  copy to check for inversion.

- Copy with destination larger than source does not duplicate the styles.

- border style double_line does handle all of the different intersection cases.

- 'General' numbers need to be formated based on the width of the cell.

- when guess the format of a possible value we should try the format associated
  with the cell FIRST rather than later.  eg enter '10-1' (without quotes) in a
  cell with an assigned format of Text.  This should be treated as text.  Instead
  It parses as a Date (Oct 1) and gets converted.

- The File->Print Preview icon is too big.  Use the stock version when the next
  release of gnome-libs is made. (tigert is adding to gnome-libs)

- Names : Sheet local vs workbook local vs application global (does that exist ?)
	: addresses not changing with row/col ins/del.

- All forms of autoscroll should use the timer mechanism from item-grid.

Function Breakage
-----------------
- Index  : does not support 0,0 or reference syntax.

Widget polishing
----------------
- gtk-combo-text
    : a value entered directly in the edit field does not handle selection in
      the list correctly
    : the list does not auto scroll.
