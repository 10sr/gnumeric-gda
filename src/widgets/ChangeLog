	text in the list items is case sensitive.
	(entry_activate_cb): New static function. Select corresponding
	list item when user enters a choice in entry field.

	(list_select_cb): Invalidate cached state if selecting cached
	widget.

	if list is visible. This makes it impossible to deselect
	interactively. 
	(cb_toggle): New callback. Handle <Ret> which by default toggles
	the list item, and make it select instead.
	(gtk_combo_text_add_item): Don't connect list_select_cb, that's

	comment at point it is called from. Use allocation geometry

	conditionals. Too much cut and paste?
