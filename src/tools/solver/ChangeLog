	assumption button.  Should be now fully working with both LP Solve
	and GLPK Simplex.
	
	* solver.c, api.c: Api changes.  Added print LP function for debugging.

	assumption options.  Framwork for max iterations and max time
	options added too.

	the obj. fn coefficents should be != 0.
	(lp_solver_init): Add checks that both LHS and RHS are numbers.

	* reports.c (solver_performance_report): Fixed the `OS' title to be bold.
	Improve the titles and add the name of the algorithm.

	(solver_performance_report): Fixed the CPU model and MHz printing
	at least for Linux.
	(get_cpu_info): Wrote.

	* solver.c (solver): Use G_USEC_PER_SEC instead of a constant.

	* reports.c (solver_limits_report): Changed the row nbr to three
	to make the title visible again.
	
2002-03-10  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* Release 1.1.1
