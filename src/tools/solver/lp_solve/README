BUILDING LP_SOLVE

Just edit the Makefile to pick the compiler, lex and yacc of your choice, and
to set the desired compiler options. Then type 'make'. After a succesful make,
type 'make test' to run a couple of examples and to test the results against
the ones I got. Also run program 'demo' to test the procedural interface.
