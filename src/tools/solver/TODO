Here is a task list for making the solver really cool
=====================================================

Regarding LP & ILP:
===================

Critical bugs:
  * if the program is infeasible report it as such
  * if the program is unbounded report it as such
  * fix all memory leaks
  * fix INT constraints order problem
  * check that if all input vars are =0 that the result is 0 or add a constant

Usability fixes:
  * report generation checkbuttons should be persistent
  * add keep original values dialog
  * check that the program is properly defined (e.g. no #DIV0, #NUM!, ...)

Feature enhancements:
  * fix assume non-negative being off
  * implement bool constraints
  * sensitivity report: fix reduced gradient
  * sensitivity report: fix lagrange multipliers
  * limits report: fix the limit reporting
  * program report: fix CPU info
  * get_lp_coeff: test that it's really LP
  * make the solver as a separate thread so that the user can continue working
    while the solver is solving the program
    - start a status dialog after a few hunderd msec if the solver is still
      counting
    - add a callback function into the solve fn for interacting with the
      status dialog
    - program report: fix user & system time reporting (need a separate thread)
  * generate a report that gives the program in math form
  * generate a report that gives the dual of the program in math form
  * add option support for the solving algorithm
    - max iterations
    - max time
    - scaling
  * add more algorithms
    - add a list selection dialog for algorithms into the main dialog
    - try to integrate SLATEC SPLP to see how it performs
    - find or implement more algorithms: e.g. some interior point method
      algorithms would be cool
  * fix all problems regarding MPS import plugin
  * add MPS export

Misc:
  * add example programs into samples/solver
    - infeasible
    - unbounded
    - ILP
  * update the user documentation
  * document the LP solving API
  * lpkit: the column numbering should start from 0
  * lpkit: remove/#if0 obsolete code
  * lpkit: fix the name space bloat


Regarding NLP:
==============

* implement support for QP (quadratic programming)
* implement support for general NLP
