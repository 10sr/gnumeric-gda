Regarding LP & ILP:
===================

Critical bugs:
  * fix crash: INT constraints support
  * fix bug: solver parameters when the sheet is duplicated

Usability fixes:
  * add warnings if data in cells is going to be overwritten
  * add `keep original values dialog'
   - fix the saving of these values twice
  * get_lp_coeff: test that it's really LP
  * add a status dialog for reporting while Solver is computing
   - add abort button into it
  * computing performance improvements:
    - make the getting of LP coefficents faster
    - the limits reporting slows things

Feature enhancements:
  * fix assume non-negative being off
  * implement bool constraints
  * add options:
    - algorithm selection
    - max iterations
    - max time
    - rounding of close zeros
    - obj. fn. range
    - show iteration results
  * sensitivity report:
    - fix reduced cost
    - fix adjustable cells: allowable increase
    - fix adjustable cells: allowable decrease
    - fix constraints: allowable increase
    - fix constraints: allowable decrease
  * performance report:
    - add options used
    - fix user & system time reporting
  * dual program report:
    - implement generation of a report that gives the dual of the program
  * MPS plugin:
    - add program export
    - finish BOUNDS support
    - implement RANGES support
    - clean up
  * add more algorithms
    - finish the GLPK support; add confugure checking for it
    - add support for algorithm specific options

Misc:
  * add example programs into samples/solver
    - infeasible
    - unbounded
    - ILP
  * update the user documentation
    - update the figures
    - write sensitivity report section
    - improve ILP section
  * fix XL import and export of the solver parameters
  * lpkit: remove/#if0 obsolete code


Regarding QP:
=============

* implement support for QP (quadratic programming)
  - support for fetching the QP obj. fn
  - QP solver API
  - QP solver algorithms
  - QP results reporting
  - QP extensions for the MPS plugin

Regarding NLP:
==============

* implement support for general NLP
