1 Regarding LP/MILP

1.1 For Gnumeric 1.2

	* Fix bug: solver parameters when the sheet is duplicated.
	* Fix bug: keep original values if solution was not found.
	* Add `keep original values dialog'.
	  - Add show iteration results list into it.
	* Clean up dialog-solver.c.
	* Speed up LP model generation.
	* Fix constraint change button.
	* Add `equal to' option for target cell.
	* Add `in range' option for target cell.
	* Improve the usability of the dialog (e.g. focus issues).
	* Add frames and improve grupping of the dialog.
	* Performance reporting:
	  - Add status.
	  - Add options used (Max/min, non-neg, int, scaling, max it/t).
	  - Clean up.
	* MPS plugin:
	  - Allow bigger models to be loaded.
	  - Improve BOUNDS support.
	  - Clean up.
	* Reporting:
	  - Add info whether assume discrete was on or off.
	* Update user documentation.
	* Add regression test suite.

1.2 Later versions

	* Made it as a plugin.
	* Reporting options:
	  - Add output selection: into a new sheet or into a cell range.
	* Sensitivity reporting:
	  - Fix reduced costs.
	  - Fix adjustable cells: allowable increase.
    	  - Fix adjustable cells: allowable decrease.
	  - Fix constraints: allowable increase.
	  - Fix constraints: allowable decrease.
	* Add a status dialog for reporting while Solver is computing.
	  - Add abort button into it.
	* Enable GLPK:
	  - Add configure check.
	  - Fix bug: INT & BOOL constraints with GLPK Simplex.
	  - Add support for algorithm specific options.
	* Add model checkings (check that a model is really LP or QP).
	* Dual program report.
	* Speed up limits reporting.
	* Add options:
	  - Algorithm selection.
	  - Rounding of close zeros.
	* Fix XL import and export of the solver parameters.
	* MPS plugin:
	  - Add program exporting.
	  - Finish BOUNDS support.
	  - Implement RANGES support.


2 Regarding NLP/MINLP

2.1 For Gnumeric 1.2


2.2 Later versions

	* Implement support for QP (quadratic programming).
	  - Support for fetching the QP obj. fn.
	  - Finish the program reporting for QP.
	  - Add QP solver algorithms.
	  - Implement QP results reporting.
	  - QP extensions for the MPS plugin.
	* Implement support for NLP (non-linear programming).
