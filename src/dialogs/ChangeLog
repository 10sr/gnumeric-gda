	* dialog-function-wizard.c (formula_guru_arg_new): Use constant
	MAX_ARGS_DISPLAYED for max # of args to display.
	(formula_guru_init): Initialize
	arg-requisition. 
	(formula_guru_set_scrollwin_size): Better way to check if we have
	already checked the table size.

2000-06-17  Jon K Hellan  <hellan@acm.org>

	* dialog-function-wizard.c (struct _FormulaGuruState,
	formula_guru_set_expr, cb_formula_guru_rolled_entry_changed,
	formula_guru_set_rolled_state, cb_formula_guru_entry_focus_in,
	cb_formula_guru_destroy, cb_formula_guru_key_press,
	cb_formula_guru_clicked, formula_guru_arg_delete,
	formula_guru_arg_new, formula_guru_init_args,
	formula_guru_init_button, formula_guru_init, dialog_formula_guru,
	dialog_formula_guru): s/FomulaGuruState/FormulaGuruState/
	(cb_formula_guru_key_press): New callback. Close guru on Esc.
	(formula_guru_init): Connect it.
	(formula_guru_set_rolled_state, dialog_formula_guru): Set focus to
	current entry.
	(formula_guru_set_rolled_state, formula_guru_arg_new): Make <Ret>
	in entry fields mean "OK".
	(formula_guru_arg_new): Record table size once we have four
	arguments.
	(formula_guru_set_scrollwin_size): New static function. Record
	table size if we haven't already done so. Set scrolled window size
	to recorded requisition for table. The upshot is that with <= 4
	arguments, the size of the argument frame is exactly right. With
	more, the viewport of the scrolled window shows 4.
	(formula_guru_init): Show dialog - needed since it is set
	invisible in glade file.

	* formula-guru.glade: Set guru invisible in glade file - reduces
	flicker. Set scrolled window border size to 4.
