This file is meant to hold a list of small tasks that need doing that would be
appropriate for new developers.

Description                                             Difficulty  Integration
------------------------------------------------------  ----------  -----------
- Ability to Create a new sheet that is a copy          Medium      Medium
  of an existing sheet.

- Financial functions (src/functions/fn-financial.c)    Medium      Very low

- Thoroughly check for division-by-zero and other       Low         Low
  arithmetic problems in functions, mostly financial.

- Add tests for all kinds of error conditions for       Low         Low
  functions to samples/regress.gnumeric so we can be
  sure that we are returning the right error code.

- Save/Restore the values of the last selected colours	Low	    Low
  from the toolbar for background or font.

- Intelligently handle setting the size of ALL		Low	    Medium
  rows/cols.  We should change the default,
  not set the size of every ColInfo.

- Have the pattern buttons in the format dialog		Medium	    Low
  reflect colour changes.

- Add MS excel like format->autoformat.  A dialog	Low	    Low
  that will display some canned styles and apply them
  to the selection.

- Audit the help text for all the functions.  Some are	Low	    Low
  missing or do not conform to the style guides, 

- Add dynamic tooltips to the toolbar combo boxes	Medium	    Low
  eg when mousing over the colour combo toolbar
     we should be told what colour is selected.

- gtk-combo-text : A prettier mouse over for the	Medium	    Low
  text entry would be nice.

Difficulty: an estimate of how hard the task would be for the average hacker.
  (This is not an estimate of project size; a project can be very big, but
   easy at the same time.)

Integration: an estimate of how much of Gnumeric's internals you need to know
  in order to take on this project
