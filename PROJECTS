This file is meant to hold a list of small tasks that need doing that would be
appropriate for new developers.

Description                                             Difficulty  Integration
------------------------------------------------------  ----------  -----------
- Ability to Create a new sheet that is a copy          Medium      Medium
  of an existing sheet.

- Financial functions (src/functions/fn-financial.c)    Medium      Very low

- Thoroughly check for division-by-zero and other       Low         Low
  arithmetic problems in functions, mostly financial.

- Add tests for all kinds of error conditions for       Low         Low
  functions to samples/regress.gnumeric so we can be
  sure that we are returning the right error code.

- Make the new combo boxes tear-off-able   		High	    Low

- Save/Restore the values of the last selected colours	Low	    Low
  from the toolbar for background or font.

- Intelligently handle setting the size of ALL		Low	    Medium
  rows/cols.  We should change the default,
  not set the size of every ColInfo.

Difficulty: an estimate of how hard the task would be for the average hacker.
  (This is not an estimate of project size; a project can be very big, but
   easy at the same time.)

Integration: an estimate of how much of Gnumeric's internals you need to know
  in order to take on this project
