Well, some words about analysys-tools:

SS = Sum of Squares
MS = Mean Square   (MS = SS/df)
df = degree of freedom

Multiple R = Multiple Regression
R Square   = coefficient of determination, but in some langs mathimatics
	     use R^2, so ask you math teacher :)
ANOVA      = ANalysis Of Variance

Ask if you want :)
