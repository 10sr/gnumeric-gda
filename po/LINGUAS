# TRANSLATORS:
# Please note that gnumeric has both po/ and po-functions/ directories.
# If you add a new language here, please make sure that both
# po/ and po-functions/ have .po files that correspond to your language.
# If you only add one to po/, the build will break in po-functions/.
#
# "id" can go back when there is a po-function translation too.
# "zh_HK" can go back when there is a po-function translation too.
# "gu" can go back when there is a po-function translation too.
