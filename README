Gnumeric -- The GNOME spreadsheet program
Miguel de Icaza <miguel@kernel.org>

This is the Gnumeric, the GNOME spreadsheet program.  

The goal of this spreadsheet is to become as powerful as other
spreadsheets on the market and do this cleanly and smartly.  We have
to do this while being as compatible as possible with Excel.

   If you are familiar with Excel, you should be ready to use
Gnumeric.  We have tried to clone all of the good features and stay as
compatible as possible with Excel in terms of usability.  

   Gnumeric is still a young program and it is advancing steadily.  If
you are interested in contributing to the development of Gnumeric, you
probably will want to read the doc/Design file.  I have scribbled my
ideas on how Gnumeric should be developed in the future in the file
doc/Future-Roadmap.
