	* SERIESSUM(), SUMA(), SUBTOTAL(), SLOPE(), AVERAGEA(),
	* MAXA(), MINA(), STDEVA(), STDEVPA(), VARA(), and VARPA().

And fixed these:

Morten:
	* Found everyone else's bugs.
	* Reworked the insert/delete column/row again.
	* Reworked the Goal Seek function to produce more accurate
	  results faster, and fail less often.
	* Improved the recalculation engine.
	* Shined up date calculations.
	* Added WEEKDAY(), DAYS360(), TIMEVALUE().
	* Fixed PROPER().
	* Improved precision here and there.
	* Fixed font-reusage when writing in Gnumeric's default file
	  format.
	* Fixed many internationalisation bugs.  Translators, please
	  make sure the default floating-point format, "0.0########",
	  has been translated for your locale.  (German translators,
	  please revisit "Zoom factor should be at least 50%" also, :-)
